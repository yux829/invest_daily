Update on $NAKA, first shilled down at $1, took some profit at $5. Still holding most of my bag. Time to play the levels now. These are the two ranges I see, I will sell the top and buy the bottom of these ranges.  Long term very bullish on $NAKA  @NakamotoGames #Metaverse  https://t.co/pdlw8Dmx9z

Update on $PYR. Entry 7.30, took some profit in the 20s to secure seed. So bullish on this project, in my top three #Metaverse and gaming bags. Dipping below 18 so it's falling into the lower range. Just playing these levels. Break above 24 invalidates  @VulcanForged @VulcanVerse

2021-11-05 23:36:44

@EthuardR @NakamotoGames These are just the ranges I am playing. I doubt it will go down but you never know.

2021-11-05 23:38:14

For those who don't get it. I do not think $NAKA is going back to 1. I am just saying if it starts to dip hard. I will buy at 1. It's just the ranges I am seeing.

2021-11-11 06:01:42

@PEPC99 @MacroCRG Why I dont want to look at stocks tomorrow.

Good to see #stablecoins $ADA and $XRP have corrected and returned to their standard price ranges.  It's was touch and go for 24 hours.

2021-11-11 07:30:19

@PabloOnChain Wise. Stable coins should never pump. It's not what they are built for.

So he says "Oh wow I can't believe I am meeting the ACTUAL lady of crypto, and you can squat 100kg with perfect form"  I looked at him trying to figure out exactly what he was getting at.  He starts to get nervous and babbles.  "I am a huge fan, I read all of your tweets"

2021-11-11 07:50:51

I was at the gym today and I noticed a guy checking me out. No problem, used to it. He kept looking at me and looking at his phone, and then back at me.   So I say to him "what's up with you?"  He says "Are you lady of crypto?"   I say "Oh you know me from twitter?"

2021-11-11 07:50:52

"on what?" I ask  "Well I hold a lot of $ADA..."  I walked away and didn't wait for him to finish. I mean $ADA? Come on.

2021-11-11 07:50:52

In school I was bullied so I learned how to box to defend myself.   It really helped with my confidence and I am quite good at it   Where was I?  Oh yes, so I got into a fighting stance and fear came into the guys eyes.  "No no no" he shouts.   "I just wanted your advice"

2021-11-11 07:50:52

I say "cool... Well Im going to go now"  "No" he replies while stepping towards me.  I got into a fighting stance right away. I don't think I have shared this on here but I am a professional boxer.  It all started when I was six years old you see.

@MuhammadSaad112 Thank you!

@frash_01 @NakamotoGames I do like the project. I dont have any ill will towards NAKA. I don't like how the hide tokenomoics info but it's not impossible to find. I think NAKA could be a good long term project.

2021-11-16 05:06:03

@Bitcephus 1/5 of the price much of the time.

2021-11-16 05:07:01

@RyanFarrugia19 Not true at all. Look at the chart image I posted. 20% dump after tokens were released. Anybody can confirm this by looking at their telegram and comparing times.

2021-11-16 05:09:06

@NakamotoGames @frash_01 Sorry but unless this has changed lately, it is not true. The only way to find them previously was to join telgram and go through pinned messages until you found the correct one. Which was one of the older ones.   Shouldn't there be a tokenomics link on your site?

2021-11-16 05:10:30

@NakamotoGames @frash_01 I have no ill will towards you guys as a project.

2021-11-16 05:11:58

@frash_01 @NakamotoGames I have no issue with the release. Naka had to release. They did a fantastic job with changing the release schedule. I know this seems like an attack on NAKA but its not. If anything its an attack on VCs

2021-11-16 05:16:30

@Bitcephus Getting a lot of money quickly is just a nice way to start a project I guess. I don't dislike projects with private sales as long as they have reasonable vesting.

2021-11-16 05:22:01

@CYBRPNK11 I have some of it but have actually not looked at the project for a while. Last I looked I was impressed by the platform

2021-11-16 05:22:22

@NaveenKumarK Probably soon. I am excited for the mainnet

2021-11-16 05:35:00

@Bitcephus I do agree though, it sucks that the rich get richer all the time. That's why I appreciate projects that don't do it that way

2021-11-16 05:47:50

@Adouble212 @polychaincap @AlamedaResearch @clover_finance From the start, Clover showed incompetence, poor communication with its community, and casual disrespect of investors. I sold long ago. It is no surprise they are thieves. I got a peek behind the curtain long ago and I didn't like what I saw.

2021-11-16 05:54:37

If you had to describe $ADA in one word, what would it be?   Mine is #stablecoin.  What's yours?  #ADA #CardanoCommunity #CardanoADA

DCAs into $LYXE have been going well. It started its retrace on Nov 4 when I made this tweet. I've done three buys since then at key support levels.  My goal is to get my average buy in as low as possible. Remember always set DCA buys before support no on it. #GameFi #Metaverse  https://t.co/iSxIWdtHWl

2021-11-17 16:34:48

It is frightening how many people are all in on crypto and hold no stable/fiat to DCA or buy dips.

2021-11-17 16:37:38

@adilism1 Sounds like you are not taking profit

2021-11-17 16:47:09

If you want to survive #crypto long term, always take partial profit and reinvest part of that profit on the dips.  Not having stable for dips and not taking profit will get you rekt. Don't listen to moonboys or permabears, they will get you rekt.  https://t.co/PHVdCNy97j

2021-11-17 16:48:18

p.s. these are not real buy levels for BTC, just an example of what to do. Real levels are taking profit at resistance and dcaing at support.

2021-11-17 16:51:54

@BobS42008364 That is why you DCA into the dip. You will almost never pick the bottom of the dip so you DCA in

2021-11-17 16:53:13

@ElonYouri Don't buy the top.

2021-11-17 17:00:48

Either the strategy on my previous tweet or this one. #Crypto market doesn't care, either you feed or somebody feeds on you.  https://t.co/2qRO0mPGnx

2021-11-17 17:19:20

@0xJonny Well that sounds stupid. I totally understand that people need to adjust their strategy around capital gains tax. I am not judging people who do not take profit regularly when it doesn't make financial sense to do so!

2021-11-17 18:32:23

@DeFiantcryptog1 @blockchainedbb I was in stocks before crypto. A 15% correction is still a crash to me. Don't get pissy with me on semantics because you are too dumb to detect obvious sarcasm.

2021-11-17 18:42:01

@DeFiantcryptog1 @blockchainedbb 100x leverage was sarcasm... the whole tweet was sarcasm.

1/ This is a rough break-down of how I played $NAKA. I did some stuff right, some stuff wrong. Some got me hate, some got me love. I was just being honest throughout. No shade on $NAKA, I think they are decent long term.

2021-11-17 20:20:09

2/ The first phase was the entry and rally. This was easy money. Pic below is from memory, it gives you a rough outline of how I played it. Example starting investment $5k. By the time the dip started I put 5k in and had 12.5k out. Maths done in my head, it might be off.  https://t.co/lbY97EhLv2

2021-11-17 20:37:03

@Brian35985361 I am less concerned because I am in it for the launchpad and I have taken out my initial investment. I think they are bad though.

2021-11-17 20:47:55

@Des3pad I use the profit to invest in other projects or to put in my dip fund. My dip fund is what I use to buy dips

2021-11-17 20:48:34

2021-11-17 22:24:16

@waaves3 Arguably more logical than a 10 trill market cap

2021-11-17 22:27:34

@CryptoPoseidonn If you mean screenshots of my exchange, you did not read the thread. This is just an example of scaling out and buying dips. Read the thread, not just the top tweet.  You can look for my follow-up on how I played NAKA for an example in practice

2021-11-17 22:28:07

@MssMoney1 No, it's easy to do.

2021-11-17 22:33:11

@CryptoPoseidonn Are you even looking at the chart?  I take profit all the way up, not at every top. Half the time I take profit it keeps moving up.   I DCA into every dip, sometimes it keeps dipping after the first DCA. That's why it's a DCA and not all in.

2021-11-17 22:36:26

@CryptoPoseidonn If you have been doing it 10 years you know the importance of scaling out at resistance and in at support. Even though it keeps moving up after you take partial profit, it's better than staying all in while it dumps.

2021-11-17 22:38:40

@FreePeteRose @CryptoPoseidonn He just doesn't understand what I am saying. He thinks I am claiming I pick perfect tops and bottoms. I just scale out at resistance and in at support. It's basic. He probably does it too.

2021-11-18 21:12:11

@Flowyfiony @AltcoinGordon Yes, so if Kucoin says they are listing a coin I am in, it pumps, I sell before listing, I buy back on the dump.  If Binance says its listing it does nothing and then dumps. Trash exchange.

2021-11-18 21:36:37

@crypto_iso I am half way through an article about this.  I think gaming is the first sector to fully decouple from BTC. Will shill the article to you when done, would like to hear your thoughts

2021-11-18 21:44:50

@CBCryptoSoda @crypto_iso I will share it publicly. I was just saying that it would be nice to have ISOs feedback because he is deep in the MV too

2021-11-18 22:40:53

Games like CSGO have an economy built around loot boxes and skins. Secondary marketplaces exist, third-party gambling sites, charting and price tracking. Even this market has peaks and troughs, 2021 saw a huge pump precipitated by a reduction in supply, followed by a dump.

2021-11-18 22:47:02

While $BTC is dipping #Metaverse and #PlayToEarn are pumping this week.  Get used to it üöÄüöÄüöÄ  Games have had full-fledged gaming coin economies since before Satoshi dreamed up #Bitcoin.

2021-11-18 22:47:03

Look at Runescape, the economy is arguably more complex than that of any #GameFi economy to date. It's had several periods of inflation and deflation over Runescape's 20 year lifespan. Chart below tracks from 2008. Source:   https://t.co/PCNSSET2qy  https://t.co/mjG7ptducl

2021-11-18 22:47:05

From MMOs to shooters many gaming economies are much older and more mature than Bitcoin, let alone new tokens like $AXS.  Game economies are perfectly comfortable operating independently. They don't care about BTC because the players don't care about BTC.

2021-11-18 22:47:05

I could give you endless examples of games with economies. Path of Exile has a booming black market earning some people hundreds of thousands per year. Which is nothing compared to WoWs black market, where the big players earn millions per year.

2021-11-18 22:47:06

When you look at a game like Illuvium or Axie, they may crash alongside BTC but I can imagine them recovering a lot quicker. Honestly, I can imagine a BTC crash not having anywhere near the impact on these two games as it would on many other alts.

2021-11-18 22:47:06

Don't get me wrong, though. If BTC crashes 30% today, I believe gaming cryptos would follow. We are not at a stage where they have fully decoupled. Many of the investors in gaming cryptos are not gamers, they are traders.  We might be at that stage soon though.

2021-11-18 22:47:07

We are already seeing signs of this over the last few days with #metaverse games rising while BTC dumps.  In the next BTC bear markets, I believe gaming cryptos will be the go-to investment for degens like us. I believe they will decouple from BTC like no sector has before.

2021-11-18 22:47:08

This is just my opinion, not financial advice. Do your own research and figure out what is right for you. Feel free to discuss below but be nice.

2021-11-19 01:15:48

Been shitposting a bit since this $BTC dump but here is a serious one.  We don't know where this dip will end. Next major support is 53k. I won't be buying anything until then.   I won't blindly ape until things settle down. Dont be a dumbass  #Bitcoin #Crypto

2021-11-19 01:19:43

@crypto_iso Nasty

2021-11-19 01:23:25

In case I wasn't clear. 53k or until things settle down. Either or.

2021-11-19 01:29:06

@livefreerc @mariusporcodio It is not a criticism, it is a joke, banter. I didn't even say his model would fail.

2021-11-19 01:30:13

@mariusporcodio Why does everything have to be so serious? I haven't criticised him at all, I just made a joke about him changing his name IF he is wrong.

2021-11-19 01:32:23

@mariusporcodio Never said it would. I said it's the next major support.

2021-11-19 01:39:43

$HERO performs very badly for a #Metaverse crypto. I still like it long term. This crash is allowing me to build a bag.  The last tweet I said 0.094 for next support and its holding well today. I will be buying once things settle down, in no rush right now.  https://t.co/Vm3VkXzZpU

If I told you about a #PlayToEarn project that has yet to be released but has investors like:  - Winklevoss twins - YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley - Manuel Bronstein CPO at Roblox - Zynga founder Mark Pincus  And a few more billionaires. Would you think it's going to be huge?

@MrSimplistic1 They started developing the tech before they decided to go play to earn route. So yes, it's made.

2021-11-19 06:02:29

@LunaCpt Haha it's really not that hard

2021-11-19 06:46:20

@jaldbazi_ Smart lad

2021-11-19 07:09:09

2/ It's not just their investors. They've developed revolutionary tech that allows you to embed AAA level games anywhere, like in this tweet, and you could play it instantly. No app, no download, no data intensive streaming like Googles failed Stadie. This is something new.

2021-11-19 07:09:09

1/ @theartieverse is the #playtoearn project I am most excited for.  Why? First, the investors:  - Winklevoss twins - Chad Hurley (YouTube) - Manuel Bronstein (Roblox) - Mark Pincus (Zynga)  When billionaires invest in a #gamefi project. It's got my attention. #P2E

2021-11-19 07:09:10

4/ They're a real game dev studio. The co-founders @ryandhorrigan and Armando Kirwin have worked in gaming AI and VR with Google, Samsung, ect. No need to go on about it, do your own research. They're as legit as you could get in crypto.

2021-11-19 07:09:10

3/ The big issue with many P2E games is that they look like they were programmed by a 14-year-old kid in 2010. Artie is different. They've been building for three years, their team comes from Riot Games, Activision, Infinity Ward, Zynga, Disney n more.

2021-11-19 07:09:11

6/   Details Project twitter: @theartieverse  Co-founder: @ryandhorrigan  Discord:  https://t.co/nU6oEhtpBm  Research notes  https://t.co/HqIZrIPEiu  https://t.co/utr0SGFXYk  https://t.co/DfSayTW1PL  https://t.co/rRlpUBMuX7 Most research from their Discord

2021-11-19 07:09:11

5/ Artie will be building more than one game. They are a game dev studio. I will be writing more about them in the coming days as I do more research. For now, I would just say, follow them, keep up with news, and get ready for when they drop their first #NFTs

2021-11-19 07:10:03

@JJcycles I think for now it's temporary. I don't think P2E is ready to break free yet. However, I think this is a shadow of what's to come. Like I say in the thread, many game economies are older than BTC and still chugging along. I don't think it's a leap to see them decouple soon üòä

@btxvision Capital. Most projects releasing tokens sell 30%-40% to VCs who dump on the market when they are 30x and crash prices. I prefer a project with tends of millions who doesn't need to sell to VCs. They are trying to build a community, that's the cool thing!

@Justin_K000 Faith is not a sustainable investment strategy. Even if for some they had it and got lucky.  Also, believing in BTC is not necessarily faith. Faith is belief in the absence of proof. To some people, Satoshi's paper was proof enough to believe and invest. That is not faith

2021-11-19 14:52:34

P.S. Nothing to do with religion. I am referencing people who have blind faith in projects or direction based on little to no proof

2021-11-19 14:53:35

@Ketzum1 Why? If the totality of your argument is to say it's stupid, it's better not to say anything at all.

2021-11-19 14:54:53

@Altcoin_mo I don't want to offend religious people

2021-11-19 14:56:54

@Crypto_Apostle1 You are confusing belief and faith. Faith requires belief, but it is belief despite proof, or even with proof to the contrary.

2021-11-19 14:58:42

@Trader_Samfire Not bad, as long as you have the stable to buy down all the way to 10k. I don't think it will reach there, but I have the stable just in case.

2021-11-19 15:00:49

@JohnDoe78084921 @Justin_K000 I am referring specifically to people who believe in the absence of proof.

2021-11-19 15:02:16

@jrthehodler This is the way

2021-11-19 15:05:31

@Ketzum1 When I use the word faith, I mean belief in the absence of proof or with proof to the contrary. To me, what you have described is a belief based on research and proof.

2021-11-19 15:09:06

@Justin_K000 No. Look it up. Faith requires belief but belief alone is not faith.

2021-11-19 15:19:03

Kind of want to delete this tweet because a lot of people think I mean "belief". That's not what I mean. I mean blindly believing in a project or a influencer without any proof or with proof to the contrary. Blind belief is not a good long term investment strat.

2021-11-19 15:21:32

2021-11-19 16:14:21

@NikP68148569 @ChrisRomanoC I think if BTC really nukes Metaverse might too though. Just not as much and not for as long.

@crypto_joey $500, need money desperately

2021-11-19 16:20:07

@NikP68148569 @ChrisRomanoC Totally possible and one of the best scenarios for me!

2021-11-19 16:24:41

@ChrisRomanoC Yep I've been witnessing it. However, we've seen other sectors temporarily decouple from BTC and then resume. So I'm not convinced this is the real deal yet. Maybe it is, I wrote about this yesterday, would love your thoughts!  https://t.co/KeR7zrHRCS

2021-11-19 16:53:18

1/ $BTC is dipping. I see a lot of degens are trying to pick a bottom and go all in. That's not how you buy the dip. Everyone tells people to #buythedip, but nobody explains how. This is how I buy dips on #bitcoin and all my #alts.

2021-11-19 16:53:19

2/ I always keep a healthy dip fund so that I can buy major dips like this one. Imagine my dip fund is 50k and I want to buy 5 cryptos in this dip, I dedicate 10k to each. You could dedicate more to one or less to the other. I am just keeping numbers easy.

2021-11-19 16:53:20

3/ If I want 10k worth of BTC, but when do I buy? I scale in at support or on breaks of support. When a major support breaks and price settles, I scale in. I might not buy every support if bearish momentum is strong, this is just a rough outline.  https://t.co/cvYp028Yxl

2021-11-19 16:53:21

4/ The idea here is that you are averaging down your buy price as BTC dips. You could make it more complicated by buying 1k on break of the 60k and 58k supports, then 2k on the break of the 53k support. Essentially, buying more the cheaper BTC gets.

2021-11-19 16:53:22

6/ Statistically speaking, scaling in or DCAing makes the most sense over the long term. This is not financial advice, do your own research, do your own maths, decide what works for you.

2021-11-19 16:53:22

5/ I have a plan to buy all the way down to 10k BTC and I will buy bigger the cheaper it gets. The argument against this is of course "well if I went all in at 58k I would make more". The counterargument is that you cannot consistently pick bottoms, no matter how good you are.

2021-11-19 16:54:44

7/ For those wondering how you find support on BTC. That is something for another thread. Although, most of the OGs here share their support area regularly

@lvwHOO That depends on my goals and how much profit I took on the run up. I take profit regularly but I also try to build my blue-chip holdings. If I want 100k of BTC and I only have 40k, then I would not sell. If I have 100k and I buy the dip, then I would take profit

1/ I genuinely do not care when $BTC dumps because.  1. I take profit religiously 2. I have a plan for buying dips 3. I invest in #metaverse and #PlayToEarn, which will decouple from BTC  If you are stressing out. You are doing this whole thing wrong.

@tgpdefi Heaps of stuff on ETH, the list is endless.

2021-11-20 00:35:11

@CryptoInKC I got 7.50 too, but not 4. I averaged down a little but not much. Noce buy at 4, that is great!

2021-11-20 00:35:43

@CryptoInKC That is a very valid point!

2021-11-20 00:38:24

@CryptoInKC Same here, I aped into that one on a tip from a friend. Usually, I am more disciplined. Had I waited, I would have bought near 5. Sometimes apes work out nicely though

@trader1sz @AvalaunchApp Launchpads in general are just money printing. BLOK launched from a launchpad and did a 700x at peak. Every time I mentioned launchpads on here people got no idea what I am talking about.

2021-11-20 07:00:29

@trader1sz @AvalaunchApp Eh? I don't know what you are on about? I am saying I agree and that launchpads print money. I invested in avalaunch when you shilled it a while back.

2021-11-20 07:11:47

@TheResonance_ @trader1sz @AvalaunchApp I am not salty. I am not sure why people are misunderstanding. I am saying launchpads print money and most people here dont even know what they are. I got in thanks to SZ weeks ago.

2021-11-20 07:13:00

@Eunicedwong @blockchainedbb Thanks gorgeous üòò

2021-11-20 07:14:42

@trader1sz @AvalaunchApp I think I understand the confusion. When I said "print money" I meant they make you rich by printing money for you. I love launchpads!

2021-11-20 07:31:30

@TheResonance_ @trader1sz @AvalaunchApp Oh yeah they do favour VCs and it can really hurt a crypto post launch when VCs dump. My biggest worry with BLOK at the moment is the VC dumps.

Serious question. Those who think $BTC is going to 200k or more this year. Where do you think the money will come from to push it there?  Not a criticism or debate. I want to hear your thoughts!  #crypto #Bitcoin #cryptocurrency

2021-11-20 15:10:43

@CanuckBtc Yes.  Ngl, I didn't care about following when I started. Now that it's flying up I am addicted to breaking those barriers. 20k is a huge one!

@cryptoyia I am not sharing my thoughts, I am asking a question

2021-11-20 15:13:00

If your answer is "that is what they said when BTC was $1k" just don't say anything. That is not an answer.  I am not starting shit, I want to know where smart people think all that money is going to flow in from.

1/ JRNYs #NFT is crazy. Mint fee is 1 $ETH for whitelist, they're selling for 2.7 eth already.  Too late to be get on the whitelist. It was only for @TheDogePoundNFT holders. I am minting mine today.  I think they will drop in price the more people mint. Long term hold for me.

2021-11-21 18:16:47

2/ They're expensive, but in my opinion they'll appreciate as JRNY adds value.  This is not financial advice. Do your own research into these. Easy for me to be bullish if I am 3x up before minting.  Will share mine when I mint!

@SatoshiNakayolo @CardanoPolice @Cyborgreddy What garbage? I built a following because I share good content and great gems. Every now and then I make an ADA, ETH, or Binance joke and some take it as a personal insult. Chill   https://t.co/pulUjlQRfm  https://t.co/d2VFdDyuSN  https://t.co/cRZidVwTky  https://t.co/KeR7zrHRCS

@SatoshiNakayolo @CardanoPolice @Cyborgreddy I do know what I am doing, making jokes.

2021-11-22 00:42:03

@blockchainedbb Sorry babe, was good while it lasted, bye

2021-11-22 01:41:23

@Big_Brother_Au I always feel pretty good. You don't if you take a joke personally

2021-11-22 02:37:23

@MarcoCo34093058 Yeah topped out and falling

2021-11-22 02:41:18

@ChrystalS18 I am negative about everything? I mostly post good content and gems. I make a few jokes about ADA, ETH, Binance here and there. You read one joke and send a negative message saying I am negative. The hypocrisy. ü§£

2021-11-22 02:42:07

@Hndsght2020 @beth_crypto I said way before I posted any ada joke that I was an ada holder. It's a in my feed. If you can't handle jokes, get off of CT

2021-11-22 02:42:52

@nicocryptope It's a joke, I am an ada holder

2021-11-22 02:50:56

@nicocryptope Hundreds found it funny, humor is subjective

2021-11-22 03:04:18

@JustKnowz @Big_Brother_Au Agreed

@technologypoet @cardano_whale I troll the ETH folks too and I hold a lot of both of those coins. Its fun.

2021-11-22 04:12:51

@cryptoshazzy Yeah I hold some but I dont talk much about it because I was in the presale.

2021-11-22 04:17:56

Been a while since I updated $MC. I bought twice, my average entry was 6.24, a floating gain of nearly 50% but struggling at the 10 resistance area.  Plan is to hold and wait for a break for 10. This is a good long term #Metaverse play.

2021-11-22 04:22:03

$SHILL is at 80% gain since I shilled it. I just took out 50% of my initial investment. This means if my initial investment was 5k I just cashed out 2.5k  #playtoearn #Metaverse #GameFi  https://t.co/rN5bqW7Gxe

2021-11-22 04:25:20

Another $RFOX update. Up 71% since I shilled it, but we were up 85% at today's high.   RFOX bounced from the ATH today. I think its just a matter of time before it smashes through it and goes into price discovery mode üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ  #Metaverse #playtoearn #GameFi  https://t.co/UbSFyhVx05

@Robert_Klondike Weird flex but okay

2021-11-22 04:28:06

@JCtoyou78 I shared this days ago and it's gone both up and down since then.

2021-11-22 04:43:38

The first time I shilled $SAND it was 0.78, we're at a floating gain of 400% now, minus the profit taken along the way.  SAND is now pulling back and I'm going to reinvest some of the profit I took near 4.30, hopeful it drops to 2.50 at least but unlikely. Plan üëá  #Metaverse  https://t.co/kqYIqebLVA

2021-11-22 04:45:28

I won't reinvest ALL of the profit taken. I am so up on this anyway.

2021-11-22 05:27:51

@blockchainedbb @PabloOnChain I think it will hit 6 with the mainnet coming but token release next month will be brutal. Remember the higher NAKA is the more likely presale holders will dump because they are up huge.

2021-11-22 05:35:27

@yohan86771691 If it goes up it goes up, if it goes down I buy more.

2021-11-22 05:43:11

@cryptolee66 Nah some.od them are great but many get really angry

2021-11-22 05:45:00

@DeFiGod1 @Adouble212 The worst is all these VCs on Twitter with 100k followers that keep shilling their shitcoins.  One of them said yesterday that their shitcoin is a blue chip. They will say anything to keep their exit liquidity in.

2021-11-22 06:20:58

@Dan82979678Dan @blockchainedbb @PabloOnChain How would you know what I was waiting for? I am not interested in holding NAKA because I am in better projects.  I am just talking facts about NAKAs token release and how VCs work. If you are too stupid to understand this, that's on you. I was right about NAKA last time.

2021-11-22 06:28:27

$UOS absolutely killing it. Up 170% since I first shilled it. Up 50% since the thread below, if you bought the dip.  UOS is one of my favourite long-term holds. I don't think its too late to get in, I believe this platform will be huge.  Wait for a dip! #PlayToEarn #GameFi

@TraderDaink I am having a great day, I hope you are too!

2021-11-22 17:39:45

Side note, this is why you shouldn't ape a rally, and you should wait for a pullback.

2021-11-22 17:39:45

$LYXE playing out as I planned. I was a late comer, and I didn't want to ape in at 40. So I waited for a dip and DCAd in as detailed in the quote tweet.  My 4th DCA has been hit and my position is nicely averaging down. 5th and 6th dca below. @lukso_io  https://t.co/d3nWpS0FSw

2021-11-22 17:42:24

@ultrastarter  https://t.co/h4LozsuBoP

2021-11-22 17:47:19

I've shared #cryptos that are up 2x-5x. Whenever I update them I get people saying it's too late to enter. That's the wrong attitude. You aren't too late if you play it smart. If it's a long-term hold with good fundamentals just wait for a dip and DCA in.   https://t.co/cRZidVwTky

2021-11-22 17:49:22

@waykewlstuff @ultrastarter I am not trying to talk you into buying. Just saying that this isn't metaverse. It is a game distribution platform, so it will have MV games as well as P2E games and non crypto games. For me it is a different sort of play to my gaming plays!

2021-11-22 17:57:52

@TraderDaink Nice, Snoop was on JRE the other day, a great episode if you didn't catch it!

2021-11-22 18:05:47

$BTC looks heavy

2021-11-22 18:10:26

@upd_king Can't win them all, if that happens I leave it. Majority of the time apeing a rally will cost me money

2021-11-22 18:21:02

@CryptoMobsterYT @lukso_io Fair enough. I don't agree with saying "best" though. Much of trading comes down to what works for you. This is what works for me. Waiting for a downtrend would mean I miss a lot of entries on minor pullbacks.

2021-11-22 18:25:54

@CryptoMobsterYT @lukso_io *downtrend to end

@honey_btc Yes, everything had been sold and put into gold

2021-11-22 18:32:21

I will yeet myself out a window before I ever add an /s to a tweet to mark it as satire.

2021-11-22 18:34:34

@JulioBReynolds No it's not. I don't respond to other peoples tweets spamming my bags.

2021-11-22 18:36:26

@drob3621 If you don't see a difference between creating a tweet on your own feed and responding to another person's tweet with unrelated spam, there is not helping you.

2021-11-22 19:21:16

@JulioBReynolds What are you talking about?  If you don't see the difference between somebody posting their bags to their own feed, and somebody spamming bags as responses to unrelated tweets, you are a smooth brain.  If you respond to people spamming your bags, you are a spammer.

2021-11-22 19:23:42

@ChrisRomanoC Thanks for the feedback and shoutout, I am happy you agree with my theory!

2021-11-22 19:49:03

@JulioBReynolds I shilled them from when my following was tiny and I keep updating them.   You can't tell the difference between spamming somebody else's feed and somebody sharing on their own feed. No reason to continue this conversation.

2021-11-22 20:29:22

4/ PLs only work because humans are trading. If the market were completely controlled by bots, they wouldn't work. People place limit and stop orders near to big round numbers, so when the market approaches those numbers, orders trigger and price reacts.

2021-11-22 20:29:22

3/ On smaller caps big rounded numbers can be more powerful, these are called major PLs. The smaller ones are called minors. More in examples below.   Why do these rounded numbers matter? Why is 75k important but not 75,182?  PLs are a self-fulfilling prophecy.

2021-11-22 20:29:22

2/ PLs are always useful, but they're best used when a crypto breaks an ATH and you have no price data you can use for SR. $BTC is the first example.  On BTC psych levels are every 1k, starting from 70k the levels are 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 78, 79, 80, 81. You get the idea.

2021-11-22 20:29:22

1/ Support and resistance (SR) is crucial in trading. Especially in #crypto where technical levels are respected. This is the first thread in a series where I will break down SR. I'm starting with the simplest form of SR, psychosocial levels (PL). #cryptotrading

2021-11-22 20:29:24

6/ This is an example of price breaking an ATH and PLs working well as targets for selling or for entering into a short trade.  I use PLs to predict where price will stall so I can take profit or where to buy more on a pullback.

2021-11-22 20:29:24

5/ Looking at $ADA as an example. The 3.00 was a major psychological barrier. When ADA was approaching it, most people expected a pullback from 3. So, they set orders are that level.  https://t.co/qw0HmKJB4i

2021-11-22 20:29:25

7/ Here is an example with $FLAME a #metaverse crypto I shilled at 1.10  https://t.co/GirprEN1WF

2021-11-22 20:29:26

10/ This is first in a series of threads about SR. I will break down more advanced SR in my next thread. I will then link all of them together into a super SR thread.

2021-11-22 20:29:26

9/ Plotting PLs on your charts when an ATH is broken can help determine where to set your limit orders. If you want to buy the dip a PL is often a good place to enter. If you want to take profit, a PL is often a good place to do that.

2021-11-22 20:29:26

8/ Here is an example with $GALA. Major PLs on GALA are 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 but 0.21, 0.22, 0.23, 0.24, 025, etc are minor PLs. GALA reacts at minor levels just before the major 0.3, 0.4 levels, as you see here.  https://t.co/x2CKETqZ2x

@Yash53500726 Look at the first tweet, PL stans for psychological level. It's in brackets next to the word

@crypto_bitlord7 Australia is mistaking COVID for a zombie virus.

2021-11-22 22:45:45

4/ I don't know if he is working with BAYC directly, but he knows the team, and he is a massive holder. Those sorts of connections are powerful in the NFT industry. I wouldn't rule out the JrnyClub and BAYC working together in future, this is speculation though.

2021-11-22 22:45:45

3/ Why do I think they 10x? Being one of the biggest influencers in this space, JRNYs NFTs are going to be popular. He will no doubt keep on shilling his NFTs in future, as he should, which will keep it popular. He also has great connections with @TheDogePoundNFT &amp; @BoredApeYC.

2021-11-22 22:45:45

2/ How do you get one? 3 ETH is a lot of money, but there's a chance prices will drop to 2 ETH or lower after the public mint. If you want one, either try the public mint or look for one post public mint on openasea. Just follow @JRNYclub for mint updates

2021-11-22 22:45:45

1/ I minted my @JRNYclub #NFT from @JRNYcrypto thanks to the @TheDogePoundNFT launchpad. Mint fee was 1 $ETH but they're already selling for 3ETH, quickest 3x I've ever seen. I didn't sell, because I think it will be worth 10x +.  In this thread I break down why  https://t.co/QdZ7pS6NHg

2021-11-22 22:45:46

7/ The roadmap talks about partnerships they have in the works. I am excited to see what they are but it would not surprise me if JRNY woks with BAYC and SAND. With the sort of reach JRNY has, he can forge partnerships with some huge names in the NFT and metaverse sectors.

2021-11-22 22:45:46

6/ JRNY is supporting community development with a community grant fund.  Future NFT sets will have 3D models that can be used in the #metaverse. The goal is to create the best NFT club in the metaverse. I wonder what metaverse game they are building in? My guess is $SAND

2021-11-22 22:45:46

5/ On to facts. As a JRNYClub holder you will get free minting of two future NFT sets. One NFT today become three in future. I don't know exactly what JRNY is doing with those sets but I have no doubt they will be huge. Collab set with DogePound? Who knows.

2021-11-22 22:45:47

9/ Last but not least as an NFT holder you get access to member's only videos from JRNY. I am sure they will contain a lot of top tier alpha.

2021-11-22 22:45:47

8/ The part I am most excited for is the launchpad. Launchpads have made me ridiculous returns. Only reason I got a JRNYclub NFT was thanks to the Doge Pound launchpad. JRNYclub will have its own launchpad and I am sure JRNY will be launching some quality projects.

2021-11-22 22:58:09

@cryptocevo Not trying to teach you anything. I know a bubble when I see one and I think there will be pain at some point for those who haven't been taking profit. That being said, I do think play to earn is here to stay and will decouple from BTC eventually.   https://t.co/KeR7zrHRCS

2021-11-23 20:16:16

@microminnow What? I dont use telegram, that is a scam.

2021-11-23 20:17:37

@TouseefAbbasii I am not saying IDOs. I am saying you find coins and get in early. Even if its a public launch.

2021-11-23 20:18:53

@microminnow It's a scam.

2021-11-23 20:26:20

1/ All in or all out is the wrong attitude. I have scaled into #Metaverse cryptos and bleed out profit along the way. If they are a bubble, and they all crash 90% tomorrow, I'll have walked away with profit.   https://t.co/d2VFdDyuSN

2021-11-23 20:26:21

3/ I won't pretend I know when the #Metaverse rally ends or if it even ends. It doesn't matter. I have realised enough profit that if every MV project rugs, I walk away with more money than I started with.

2021-11-23 20:26:21

2/ In my opinion, this is the key to being a successful investor. You scale into the rally by buying the dips. You take profit by selling the peaks.  If executed correctly, you will end up with realised profit while still holding a large bag.

2021-11-23 20:27:17

@microminnow I am telling you it is a scam. That is a fake account, it is not me.

2021-11-23 20:28:33

@TouseefAbbasii I know. I am in a lot of launchpads. You can usually get in at launch for 3x-5x more than launchpad people.

2021-11-23 20:43:32

@cryptoaladeen Can buy mine for $7 a pop and keep the box?

2021-11-23 21:24:20

3/ You can find gems by visiting a LPAs website and looking for projects that are launching. You won't be able to get in presale if you don't hold the LPA, but nothing is stopping you from getting in after public release.

2021-11-23 21:24:20

2/ You need to be aware of vesting schedules, so you can plan for dips when presale holders dump. This info is on the LPAs telegram.  If you don't know what a LPA is, it's a service that promotes and launches cryptos. Holders of the LPA crypto get presale prices.

2021-11-23 21:24:20

1/ This is the first in a series of articles on gem hunting. I'll start with the easiest way, launchpads (LPAs).  Some say that LPA #cryptos aren't gems because of presellers price dumping, but I got a lot of good #PlayToEarn and #Metaverse gems for LPAs. They're üíé imo.

2021-11-23 21:24:23

6/ Just make sure you actually research the projects before jumping in. Just because its launching through a LPA it doesn't make it good. Do your research to decide if the project is worth investing in. Don't forget to add vesting dates to your calendar.

2021-11-23 21:24:23

5/ Like any project you still need to do your research and make sure the launching project is a good one. In order to find launching projects you go to the launchpads site. Here are a few   https://t.co/gEm28QiJ8w  https://t.co/pbgyTbRFi1  https://t.co/qn1pDi86uP

2021-11-23 21:24:23

4/ Even if you do not get in at presale prices, the upside potential on many of these projects is huge. I would not buy on public release day as they usually dip after launch volatility, and you can buy in cheaper.  https://t.co/UwwgUheXSP

2021-11-23 21:24:24

7/ This is the easiest ways to find gems before they release. It's gem finding for lazy people. I will share more techniques in future threads.

2021-11-23 21:26:09

@cryptoaladeen I dont like watches, but I like money!

2021-11-23 21:30:27

@cousincrypt0 Buying all the USD I can. 1 USD today will be worth 100 USD when inflation goes out of control!

2021-11-23 21:47:29

If you follow a VC and you think they care about making you money. Remember, they are already up 50x when they are telling you to buy, and they will dump on you without shedding a tear.  I'm sure some of them are good people but I wouldn't count on goodness.

2021-11-23 21:48:34

P.S. Any time I share a project I bought presale I make it clear and I say when I am selling.

2021-11-23 21:49:31

Who knows if you can trust me though? I am honest but you shouldn't blindly trust anyone who is up huge and telling you they won't dump.

2021-11-23 21:56:36

@cryptocevo Loving your tweets today. I get asked for EOY predictions every day.  Making a prediction like that can only hurt your trading. You decide some crypto is going to 10 and it clouds your judgement when it tops at 5 and it's time to sell.  Also, like you say, noone knows

2021-11-23 21:58:53

@daaku100x Good

2021-11-23 22:03:49

@Mr_E_Graves Nice, I was in the presale for it so I did not shill it but i think its a great project. I am apprehensive about shilling stuff I bought presale!

2021-11-24 01:25:59

@blockchainedbb As long as it doesn't go downhill as fast as ADA.

2021-11-24 02:14:59

2021-11-24 03:01:26

@itsmeace00 @FrankLambeek @verasitytech No I am invested in VRA, I understand it. I just don't understand this add. What is built on it? I don't get what they are advertising.

2021-11-24 04:30:26

1/ When I first looked at $LYXE I wasn't blown away. Big mistake, this #metaverse and #NFT crypto is an absolute gem. Now I have my second chance and I won't waste it.  I've shared my LYXE entries already, I've gone bigger at 17. This one is a 3-6 month hold.  @lukso_io  https://t.co/Mh92GS9fTF

2021-11-24 04:30:27

2/ Lukso is a #blockchain for #NFTs using ETH 2.0 proof of stake. At least it will be when the mainnet comes out. It is dipping right now because the mainnet was delayed. Delays are good, it means they aren't rushing out something that doesn't work to keep people happy.

2021-11-24 04:30:28

4/ Lukso uses what they call "virtualization" to turn physical assets into NFTs. This means you can bring something physical onto the blockchain as an NFT. This also means that you could bring physical objects into the metaverse.

2021-11-24 04:30:28

3/ It also means that paperhands have gifted me prices I thought I would never see again, thanks üòò  Why is Lukso so good?  First, it gives you an identity in the metaverse that you can take from MV to MV, even on different blockchains. Some other cryptos do this.

2021-11-24 04:30:29

5/ Lukso says it allows brands to create tokenized communities. Honestly, I find this statement confusing. So I did some digging for examples, and I found a few.  Lukso enables fashion brands to create and sell digital clothing that can be used in the metaverse.

2021-11-24 04:30:30

6/ At first this sounded weird, but think about it. Nike wants to release sneakers that you can wear in the metaverse. People are crazy about sneakers, ever heard of sneaker heads? Nike could create and sell those sneakers on Lukso because it provides the infrastructure to do so.

2021-11-24 04:30:31

7/ Fashion is a $1.4 trillion industry, so when it moves into the metaverse, I want to be ready. I believe Lukso is the on-ramp for fashion to the MV. In fact, it has already started with this digital fashion piece selling for 100 ETH on Lukso   https://t.co/cgPDKqpkIy

2021-11-24 04:30:32

8/ Fashion in the metaverse will be huge. Look at all the people showing of Rolex's and Lambos on twitter. Crypto people are new money, and if there is anything new money likes, its flashing gaudy stuff to show off how rich they are. There is certainly a market for it here.

2021-11-24 04:30:33

9/ The tokenomics are great, a tiny 15m supply until mainnet. 30% was sold in private sale, will be unlocked at mainnet launch. Which means things could dip at launch, but that is 6 months away according to the article below. Until then, no VCs to dumps!   https://t.co/JMxJte7nZG  https://t.co/I8aHcceRL2

2021-11-24 04:30:34

10/ The team for Lukso is absolutely amazing. @feindura author of ERC 20 and ERC 725 and lead dapp developer of Ethereum. @m_h_d_v co-founder of Dematerialized, creator of EY Innovation Lab. Along with expert advisors  https://t.co/q3r5uRC9Fm

2021-11-24 04:30:35

12/ I also heard that @RaoulGMI is looking into LYXE which is big. He is the reason I got into RFOX, another metaverse project I am in that is giving huge returns.   https://t.co/ZcX0wW8XbN

2021-11-24 04:30:35

11/ I've shared my plan for LYXE before. I bought a big bag at 17 today. I have some reserves to buy at 12, but I am not convinced it reaches there.  Do your own research, none of this is financial advice. I am sharing my plan and that is all.   https://t.co/KSxD5stU2C

2021-11-24 04:30:36

13/ Lukso is dipping, so after you do your research, if you like it, just consider that it can go lower than where its at now. I am ready to average down.

2021-11-24 04:36:05

@PEPC99 Sorry I got confused. I thought we were discussing UOS. DCA isn't bad at 45 and 32 like she says

2021-11-24 06:45:16

@cryptochecovf That is just embarrasing

2021-11-24 07:15:31

1/ $FLAME has changed its launchpad tiers.   Previously, owning 10k or 25k FLAME gave you guaranteed allocation. Now they've switched to some convoluted tier system.  From what I can make out only the top 25 holders get guaranteed allocation.  https://t.co/jwENQGmeW2

2021-11-24 07:15:32

3/ I don't have the time or willingness to dump another $30k into FLAME just to get the allocation I was promised. If that is even enough.  There are better launchpads out there with teams that don't randomly change their rules.  Closing FLAME with good profit.

2021-11-24 07:15:32

2/ You also need a Hiro NFT. What's that? Well, good luck finding out. There is no easy to find link on where to buy a Hiro. I heard they are 3 ETH but can't confirm.  Launchpads should be simple, and shouldn't randomly change rules to benefit whales.

2021-11-24 07:17:41

@_VLaaD_ @melozie0x @lukso_io Read 14/   Why do people comment before reading the whole thread?

2021-11-24 07:19:33

@melozie0x @_VLaaD_ @lukso_io Also you would sell because 30% of the supply is unlocked and presale investors might be up 100x. It makes sense that they would dump so derisking at launch and getting back in on the dip makes sense. Just my opinion based on historical examples.

2021-11-24 07:22:40

@bignosewhoknos @lukso_io @daddyjamesy 20k wont move the price will it?

2021-11-24 07:23:44

@alexandre_lores Please dont tell me I can actually cause a dip.

2021-11-24 07:28:24

@melozie0x @_VLaaD_ @lukso_io Oh yeah I would expect it to be much higher by the time the mainnet is out. If its back in the 40s or higher I will probably sell off a chunk before the mainnet. I think this is a long term hold though, could end up being one of the biggest blockchains.

2021-11-24 07:29:46

@bignosewhoknos @lukso_io @daddyjamesy @dematerialised I think I need to be careful with what I tweet maybe.  No I haven't, I will add it to my list for tomorrow, thank you!

2021-11-24 07:34:26

@Akiz16 It seems like I caused a small dump and the idea that I could be responsible for that scares me.

2021-11-24 07:35:47

@Crypto_holix There are good launchpads too. This is a bad example.

2021-11-24 08:05:36

@cloudzombi @Akiz16 @firestarter_fi I think my tweet caused it, not me selling, although I am sure the selling didn't help

2021-11-24 08:10:33

GN Degens üòò  It appears though my tweets can actually cause price dumps on smaller caps. I guess it was inevitable, I just never thought about it. It's scary.  Still getting to grips with this whole having a following thing and learning along the way.

2021-11-24 08:20:13

@UJD07326336 I guess it depends on what your total portfolio is outside of crypto. I have larger portfolios outside of crypto.

@toneyourlife When presale holder tokens are unlocked. If they are up by a big amount they may dump their tokens. Increases circulating supply.

How many bags do you have?  Not handbags, #crypto bags. I have over 30.

2021-11-24 17:50:36

2/ Launchpads mint millionaires. If you know any good-looking new launchpads, share them, so others can research and buy.  SFUND is too expensive for most people at this point, but let's find the next SFUND!

2021-11-24 17:50:36

1/ Talk about life-changing gains. $SFUND has just blasted off again. I bought it at 0.9 and it hit 14.85 today.  #Launchpads really are where it's at. Not only has SFUND floating at a 14x gain. It also got me into $BLOK, $FINA, $CWAR, $TRY presales and many more.

2021-11-24 17:54:16

@ChrisRomanoC Its fascinating how people differ. I find it so easy to manage my bags the way I have everything set up. I was just having this conversation with a friend.  If I limited myself to 5 bags I would have skipped many great projects like SFUND, UFO, and others

@Quamfy_Trader @CryptoMobsterYT Fiat would be kept in other financial markets, like stocks, commodities etc and is not counted!

2021-11-24 19:47:48

2/ Back then ILVs market cap was 350 mill to Axies 8 bill. Now ILV is approaching 1 bill and Axie is still floating around 8.  ILV has incredible room for growth. I believe it can be bigger than Axie next year.  The worst thing about ILV are its tokenomics.

2021-11-24 19:47:48

1/ If I had to pick games I think will flip Axie, $ILV would be one of them.   I first shared ILV on October 2nd when it was $550. Every time I shared it since people said "it's too late" or "it's too expensive".  I never understood that. #PlayToEarn is just getting started.

2021-11-24 19:47:49

3/ I plan to do a long thread of ILV in which I will cover the tokenomics along with other aspects.

2021-11-24 19:53:18

@MarkAkramzz People said it was late at 550 and today its 1.7k. People will say It's late today, and in a few months it will be 6k.

2021-11-24 20:08:21

@nickyb1982 @ChrisRomanoC One thing that helps me a lot is my friends. They are not too active on CT but they are good traders. They each have their own sector, I am obviously the gaming one. So I focus mostly on gaming, one guy on passive, one on bluechips, etc.

2021-11-24 20:17:49

@ChrisRomanoC It can do but  I do have friends and we share the load. I am in a few DAOs and I know next to nothing about them. I trust my friend to do his research and keep up to date on them.  I should have explained myself properly when I said its easy. Easy with mates, not solo!

2021-11-24 22:39:03

@crypto_iso The more bug influencers become convinced that gaming decouples from BTC. The faster it will decouple.

2021-11-24 22:40:47

@crypto_iso I would argue that we have seen sectors do this before and then come back into the fold. I want to see a permanent decoupling. While I really hope we are there, I am not convinced.

2021-11-24 22:44:11

@crypto_iso I have, I keep track of it daily. I am so deep in gaming cryptos that I hope this is the new normal. I am not disagreeing that we are currently decoupled. I am just not convinced it's permanent. I am trading as if it is permanent, though.

2021-11-24 22:45:37

@crypto_iso *big

2021-11-24 23:02:01

@CryptoMobsterYT @crypto_iso I only listen to myself. I am saying that people like him, regardless of his past, can manifest reality with their influence. The more people like him convince followers gaming is its own thing, the sooner it happens. It is inevitable, maybe it's already happened.

2021-11-24 23:11:26

@CryptoMobsterYT @crypto_iso It could happen, anything could happen really. I ma not convinced MV doesn't crash if BTC nukes. Let's just see where it goes

2021-11-24 23:12:09

@May1968Paris Thank you üôè

2021-11-24 23:17:45

@crypto_iso @broccolierabe @CryptoMobsterYT Same. I like what Becker is doing for gaming cryptos, but he is not my friend, he is not looking out for me.  I have my own investment plan, I execute it, and if it all goes to crap I can only blame me.

@sweetsinner3 So many questions.  Is this a role play thing, so if I have a man NFT can I be a man? What if I have a dog NFT, are dogs invited? What is the threshold for "rich"? Will I be sent NFT dick pics, because "no thanks"?

$LYXE turning around. I was hoping to buy more at 12-13 but looks like 17 was my last chance to load up.   I took full advantage of the chance at 17 and now have a huge bag.  Did you join in? (after doing your own research)

2021-11-25 17:34:57

If you want to make it in this game, you need to be ready to cut and run without emotion. No bag is worth getting rekt over.  p.s. Watched Heat last night.  https://t.co/7b2M32W4KU

I've been building a bag of $ROSE the last week and a half. I am going to do a thread on it.  I am not up a lot since I have been averaging in. Only around 30%.  Look into it, do your own research, or wait for my thread.  I am excited about it.  @OasisProtocol

@TysonThe2nd This is true, it was a trick question, you got it Tyson.

2021-11-25 18:14:56

@dsilva_gary @DemirtopEray @OasisProtocol I had a brief look and it did not catch my attention. I will take another look.

2021-11-25 19:03:31

@Umranbasha1976 @OasisProtocol Any amount of coins, a bag is just a position, for some it's $10 for others it's $10 mill

2021-11-25 19:19:47

@adilism1 You can be as childish as you want, I am, I wasn't talking about that!

2021-11-25 19:24:09

@lee6ilbert I've shilled it for weeks and post about it almost daily. Apparently I am a top 10 influencer for it  https://t.co/usWT4YDJOr

2021-11-25 19:48:42

1/ Last week I wrote about #Metaverse and #PlayToEarn cryptos decoupling from $BTC.  Every day that goes by, that is looking more and more like reality. Will it last? I am hopeful, but not convinced.   https://t.co/KeR7zrqgei

2021-11-25 19:48:43

2/ This chart shows $MVI, which is the Metaverse index, an index of several MV cryptos overlaid on a $BTC chart.  Since the end of September MV has decoupled from BTC. This was due to Zuckerberg changing FBs name to Meta. News based decoupling is common and not noteworthy.  https://t.co/oDYogjieHg

2021-11-25 19:48:44

5/ What happens if BTC nukes from here? I find it hard to believe that gaming cryptos will not react. However, some of them have such strong uses cases that they might just survive.  Look at $PYR, there is already a huge user base, but it's going to get bigger.

2021-11-25 19:48:44

4/ I think much of this is FOMO driven, but I am starting to believe a lot of it is real. #PlayToEarn and #Metaverse legitimately seem to be breaking away.  We might have the first case of an entire sector decoupling from $BTC.

2021-11-25 19:48:44

3/ From the 10th of November, things have become strange. We are seeing a true decoupling. Last week I thought it was momentary and things would reset. One week later the gap is only getting bigger.  Is it permanent?

2021-11-25 19:48:45

8/ So is this a temporary decoupling like we have seen sectors do before? Or is this one the real deal?  I believe that only time will tell, but I am very excited I got in early and that I shared it with you lovely people.  Thoughts?

2021-11-25 19:48:45

7/ Then look at this, Grayscale sees metaverse as a sector with separate growth potential to BTC.   https://t.co/F00nfYqR1a

2021-11-25 19:48:45

6/ Their players are there for the game, not for the price of BTC.  Look at $UOS, a game distribution platform that will host crypto and non crypto games alike. It has its own blockchain, it is its own thing.   Why would UOS users care about the price of BTC?

2021-11-25 19:50:24

@TysonThe2nd $DOT gonna die

2021-11-25 20:00:23

@Lifeisgood1232 Yep, very different, is what it is!

2021-11-25 20:54:12

@Lifeisgood1232 It does, most people are awesome here!

2021-11-25 20:59:35

@Rebelshin Not really talking about if it will go up or down but if it will be independent of BTC.

2021-11-25 21:00:19

@SindromeBinario Agree with this, the tech needs to keep pace but I am not convinced it is.

2021-11-25 21:01:16

@MikeyFergus_ Yeah I think it will too but I am not thinking about whether it will go up or down, just that it might become independent.

2021-11-25 21:02:24

@ChrisRomanoC Yes and that is one of my biggest roadblocks at the moment. It takes time and most companies are even close to a working product.

2021-11-25 22:34:31

@crypto_sannna @futrii @Crypto_holix @zachxbt You have a screenshot from the 19th that to me just seems like one of her many friends pumping her up a bit. What has that got to do with today?

2021-11-25 22:37:20

@crypto_sannna @futrii @Crypto_holix @zachxbt where are all of these imaginary screenshots? you said there are five? stop lying kid.

2021-11-25 22:40:09

@crypto_sannna @futrii @Crypto_holix @zachxbt You say there are five, I see one. The one is from the 19th, doesn't explain today.  All I see is a screenshot of a dude who probably knows her shilling her. I shill her all the time.

2021-11-25 22:44:22

@crypto_sannna @futrii @Crypto_holix @zachxbt What does the 19th have to do with the 25th. Could you please explain this simple fact?  You said you have 5 screenshots, where are they? Why are you lying about this? Why say you have 5 when you don't. You have a single unrelated screenshot.

I've been in crypto for 2 years as a boring BTC, ADA, LTC, etc HODLr. I decided to throw 4 figures into #gamefi this year and here we are.  The $1 mil doesn't even include my sidelined stable or NFTs. It's just my floating, which is 62%. I made it, I am in my 20s.

2021-11-26 03:28:46

@behardien17cfc @LegacyofAshes I played the levels like I always do

2021-11-26 06:06:14

$NGL is absolutely getting sent. We are up 22% from when I shilled it.  This one is a long term hold for me. It has everything needed to be one of the big boys in the #metaverse and #PlayToEarn genre.

2021-11-26 06:10:32

I had 22k when I woke up, I make that tweet below, and now I hit 40k.  What is going on?  This cant be real life. I have not even been here three months.  https://t.co/8u0TappWx4

2021-11-26 06:16:26

For the record. I gave you a heads-up 6 weeks ago about $NGL.   Not many people listened.  Now it's blowing up.  Who has the alpha?  For those asking where to buy. Huobi, Pancakeswap.

2021-11-26 06:25:38

@salman_ahmed786 yes

2021-11-26 06:27:22

@Jeff19724501 Well, not a 50x anymore since it went up but play the levels and yes it could hit a 2 bill market cap

2021-11-26 06:27:41

@JamesGrewal69 I just did

2021-11-26 06:32:24

The secret to holding bags for so long, like I did with $SAND, is that you don't set arbitrary targets and get out. You bleed profit out slowly as your bag rises.   https://t.co/d2VFdDyuSN  Then reinvest in the dips.   https://t.co/cRZidVwTky

$BTC ruining everyone's fun as usual

2021-11-26 16:43:34

@Karthik19039961 Eh? it did a massive pump to 40

2021-11-26 16:47:34

Just a reminder of my $BTC dip plan.  I keep money sidelined to buy the dips. I have a plan to buy BTC as low as 10k. The deep the dip the bigger I go.  This is why I take profit religiously. To be able to buy when it gets red.

2021-11-26 16:51:50

@xanthamgum Units dont matter, its just an example. If you have 500k or if you have 1k, the amounts are not the point.

2021-11-26 16:59:52

BLACK FRIDAY DEALS  $BTC prices slashed 20% $ETH prices slashed 20% $ADA prices slashed 30%

@cryptodiary0000 I think the next big sector will be adult entertainment

2021-11-26 17:20:27

@buffermet @xanthamgum It doesnt in this scenario. I am not telling people to use 50k, I am just using 50k as an example  It could be 500k split 100k pots  It could be 5m split into 1m pots  It could be 5k split into 1k pots  It could be 20k split into 1k pots if you want to do 20 coins

2021-11-26 17:22:19

@xanthamgum Okay I thought you meant the pot size.  The BTC bottom price. I only talk about BTC price in USD. Also, it does not really matter in this scenario. I am not saying 10k is the bottom, I am saying I have a plan to buy as low as 10k.  My entire point is that I don't know the bottom

2021-11-26 17:44:14

@crypto_birb Give 5 analyst's a chart and you gat 5 different opinions on where it's going

2021-11-26 17:48:44

2021-11-26 17:54:47

@xanthamgum @coinskid ü§£üòÇ  You cant pick tops or bottoms. That why I scale in and out instead!

2021-11-26 18:01:09

I'm going to go out today.  This market is not for buying. I'll reassess alts if or when $BTC is 53k and then 50k to decide if I want to buy.  Most of my bags are way up because I am in #PlayToEarn and #Metaverse, and I've taken profits as below   https://t.co/d2VFdDyuSN

@crypto_iso I tweeted this.  Now I am getting asked for my next gem in every tweet lol. I do not think it's something you should envy.  It's why I have been off most of today. Trying to figure out if I should keep doing this.   https://t.co/qSY6RLAy0A

@crypto_iso As far as I am concerned I do not deserve this and not sure I want the pressure.

$PYR is the one.  I got in at 7.   @crypto_iso and SZ got in at 3.  @ChrisRomanoC brought it to Twitter.  These are the guys you should be following as well. They know #PlayToEarn and #Metaverse

2021-11-27 01:53:32

I shared $NGL before it was released six weeks ago.  I shared it again yesterday at $5.  Now it almost hit $9 on a day that $BTC is dumping.  #Metaverse and #PlayToEarn game with a 100 mill MC. It's just getting started.

2021-11-27 01:57:11

@NiffoBTC This is it. I said I was posting it and an hour later I posted $NGL. I am not sure why people are struggling to understand this?

2021-11-28 07:25:00

@tooshay_booshay 50x from what?

2021-11-28 07:42:36

1/ $CRAFT  - Low market cap ($252 m) - #Metaverse &amp; #PlayToEarn - On $AVAX - The game looks amazing - VC vesting is great  Not financial advice, do your own research.  @Talecraftio #NFT #NFTGame

2021-11-28 07:42:37

2/ -POTENTIAL- Metaverse is a booming sector. A $25m market cap would put this in the top 80 metaverse. In my opinion this is much higher than a top 80. Long-term I would expect a market cap of a few hundred million.  This is not financial advice, it's my personal expectation.  https://t.co/2maYi9Am34

2021-11-28 07:42:38

3/ -TOKENOMICS- The tokenomics for CRAFT are phenomenal. 1.7m circulating supply at the moment, the max supply is 30m but there is a burning mechanism which will eat away 5m of the supply.  CRAFT is required in order to play the game, which will keep demand for the token high.  https://t.co/Dckrhe5ni6

2021-11-28 07:42:39

4/ -NO PRESALE DUMPS- Presale investors receive 5% on TGE and won't receive more tokens for 90 days, therefore they won't be able to dump. After that, they are vested for 15 or 18 months vesting.  Good vesting is the mark of a good project.  https://t.co/Dyz5EruTvV

2021-11-28 07:42:40

6/ -MY PLAN- I will be scaling in and buying the dips. I never ape in a full bag unless I am in presale. As with anything, do not be a dumbass.

2021-11-28 07:42:40

5/ -BUYING- Buying was a pain. I had to bridge from ERC20 to AVAX C Chain using the official AVAX bridge (DYOR) and then buy on Trader Joe.  You can also buy AVAX on KuCoin and withdraw to C Chain.

2021-11-28 07:45:39

@ThatRobinBanks It's a copypasta

2021-11-28 17:25:09

@honey_btc GM gorgeous, what a view.

2021-11-28 18:02:13

1/ This is how I bought $SAND at 0.06 and held it till today.  I talk about scaling in and out all the time, but visualising how to do it over several months, and retraces, is hard.   Now you have a rough guide. These numbers are not precise but close enough. NFA DYOR  https://t.co/ULGI7S8yiI

2021-11-28 18:02:14

2/ So when people ask "what's your target"  I do not have one. I invest for the long term scale-out profit at resistance and scale in at support on dips.  For $SAND I was using psychological levels as support and resistance.   https://t.co/aAe6RE1h2A

2021-11-28 18:02:15

3/ Here are guides on buying dips and taking profit  https://t.co/d2VFdDyuSN  https://t.co/cRZidVwTky

2021-11-28 18:04:36

4/ If I believe a project will continue to grow, targets do not make sense. It's like setting a target on $BTC when if I bought in 2011.  I am not shy about taking profits and reinvesting, but setting an arbitrary target is not my style.

2021-11-28 18:05:24

@salman_ahmed786 The entire point I am making here is that I don't have targets, I scale in and out.

2021-11-28 18:10:49

5/ I scale out my initial investment at 20% at a time as it goes up. So with an entry at 0.06  0.12 - 20% out 0.18 - 20% out 0.24 - 20% out 0.30 - 20% out 0.36 - 20% out  Depending on the crypto and the outlook, I may scale-out faster than this. This was a slow scale-out.

2021-11-28 18:19:39

@srg_green Yes that and also psych levels

2021-11-28 18:20:24

@seanwilks87 My friend has 20 years of trading experience, he taught me.

2021-11-28 18:23:50

@fatiralvi What?

2021-11-28 18:26:00

@seanwilks87 I hold it still

2021-11-28 18:27:07

6/ Adding this to say I still hold $SAND and I am still buying and selling the dips. My first tweet sort of made it sound like I sold SAND today. I did not, I am a long term holder.

2021-11-28 18:38:00

@robbievblfc @cryptosavage8 I gave the warning so people had a few hours to get set up to use Trader Joe. I don't normally do it that way, but I wanted everyone to have a fair chance.  It pumped 30% from the time I gave the warning to the time I shilled. My expectation here is a 10x so 30% doesn't matter

2021-11-28 18:39:43

@ct_chain Great. Good thing I have been taking profit. I will buy the dip at 4 and 3 and 2 if it gets to it.

2021-11-28 20:03:45

@stbEXbanker 30 normally but I could have up to 60. It's quite easy if you have a proper sheet that is built for the job.  I am not tracking every crypto as much as something like SAND. Shitcoins and bluechips get nowhere near as much scaling in and out.

2021-11-28 20:04:45

@stbEXbanker Also, this is a daily chart, at most I need to record a few trades per day. I think a 200x return is worth this effort personally.

2021-11-28 20:20:31

@bozinggg I think you are misunderstanding. I sold and bought back far cheaper. If I just HODLd my performance would have been far worse.

2021-11-28 20:29:38

@jimtalbot @trader1sz If having a twitter excludes you from presales though, that is a bad deal. Presales are absurdly profitable.

@trader1sz ADA LFG

2021-11-28 20:59:32

If you dont use $MVI to keep track of how #metaverse is performing as a whole, you should. MVI is an index that combines some of the top MV and #PlayToEarn tokens like $ILV, $MANA, $AXS, $SAND, $YGG and more.  It gives you an idea of how gaming cryptos are performing.  https://t.co/xrSsYbcAYw

2021-11-28 20:59:33

Another fun thing is to overlay a BTCUSDT chart on MVI to see how Metaverse has decoupled. At least its fun for me because I am a chart geek.  https://t.co/qdzER7HUvE

2021-11-28 21:28:03

I shared this 2 days ago and my following exploded.  My story is true, but I didn't only pick winners. I picked cryptos that dumped. I got rugged. I bought tops. I sold bottoms.   I put 5 figures on $BUNNY at $500. That was a -99.5% lesson.  I am not perfect. I am often wrong.

2021-11-28 21:28:04

I keep going though.   When I pick a good crypto I take profit religiously and reinvest the dips, or into other projects.  I research my ass off to find projects early. When I do get in late I scale in dips instead of ape.  I have a small team and we share research.

2021-11-28 21:28:05

Success isn't always being right. It's about accepting when you're wrong and learning from it. It's also about working as hard as you can to achieve your goals.

2021-11-28 21:31:28

Oh and if you get in projects early. Accept that 5 out of 10 will do nothing. 2 will do almost nothing, 2 will make you some money, and if you're lucky, 1 will make you a fortune. If you have the sense to play it right.

@CanteringClark So much salt in the comments. Why cant anyone ever be happy for anyone?

2021-11-29 01:03:44

@CanteringClark Yes, I am exaggerating a bit. Most people have been lovely. Just very weird for me to see hate thrown my way when I feel like I didn't do anything to deserve it.   It is a crazy number, I was at 22k that morning, by the next day I was 3x.  Surely not a record though?

2021-11-29 01:04:44

@sol_theprofit @CanteringClark What are you talking about? I always say when I get in. When I say "hope you all got in" its because I am quote tweeting and the previous tweet was the one saying I got in.

2021-11-29 01:08:40

@sol_theprofit @CanteringClark If you look at the chain of tweets, I tweeted every step along the way, now its up 60%   https://t.co/H0Tbw0H5YQ  Or HTR today up 20% from where I tweeted   https://t.co/2ysdP0o8lN  Do you people just make stuff up for fun or are you to dumb to look at the quoted tweet?

@psyidon @bozinggg A spreadsheet helps with the calculations.

2021-11-29 01:27:50

@Vince_Zurich It's possible but in this case I tweeted 3 hours ago and HTR only moved 30 min ago in a big way.

2021-11-29 05:33:59

$NGL dipped today like other #Metaverse tokens. It looks to be recovering now.  We're up 60% from the 5 entry I tweeted. Unfortunately, I didn't add more on this dip.   The barrier atm is 10.00, if it breaks, I see a rally. Not financial advice, do your own research.  https://t.co/pBMe4Lfotl

2021-11-29 05:34:00

In my opinion, NGL has PYR like the potential of hitting a 750 mill MC or more. The current MC for NGL is 100 mill, it has a lot of room to grow.

@AdvocateAda A joke is not FUD.  Fear Uncertainty Doubt  Where is "humor" in that?  From when I had no followers I said I own Cardano but I made jokes about it because I like making jokes. I also joke about ETH, is that FUD.

2021-11-29 20:32:16

@AdvocateAda Your entire identity is tied to a single asset, that means you are not a serious investor. Anybody makes fun of the asset you have married yourself to, you get defensive. Weird.

2021-11-29 20:44:48

My top three #Metaverse projects  $PYR $RFOX $UFO  Was 200% up on RFOX, as with any crypto, I take partial profit when up. Looking to reinvest in this dip. 0.235 looks like the ideal spot!

2021-11-29 20:48:19

@VRA_FAN_BOY What is an RFOX?

2021-11-29 20:51:52

@Nakamotolisk I am unusually smart for a human.

2021-11-29 21:56:49

@c33xbt There is significant support at 0.22. Support is somewhat subjective but I am confident in that one. My support has a pretty good track record if you look at all my calls.  I don't mind if it doesn't come, I am just saying if it does, I buy. I buy before support, hence .235  https://t.co/vNciYP90ks

2021-11-29 22:24:02

@MacroCRG I got a genuine question. Is this the coin that Inversebull and his crew are all in? The creator is a dude with a tophat or a fedora or something?

2021-11-29 22:38:13

@MacroCRG Me neither. I think the dude who made HEX is now working on Pulse Chain. It's meant to be the next Hex but better. I have it on my research list but haven't started my research.  I don't know much about either project but I will buy a little pulse regardless in case it does a hex

2021-11-29 22:41:20

@meerkat_crypto @drfahad200 Fair, I hadn't moved it off exchange yet anyway

2021-11-29 22:43:04

@Nina89751611 I shared them a while ago. I will share more stuff as I invest in it!

2021-11-29 22:59:45

@Knowcoinery I love the salt

2021-11-29 23:06:45

@spinholz @Razvan_CR11 50x from when I mentioned this. I believe the market cap was 50 mill at the time. 2.5 bill in the next year or two is easy for a good game.

2021-11-29 23:17:34

@kryptonicko I own some

2021-11-29 23:22:55

2/-POTENTIAL- I look at market caps of similar games to gauge where a project can go.  $NGL 96m  $PYR 750m (8x) $ALICE 600m (6) $ILV 1b (10x) $AXS 8b (80x)  Compared to its peers, NGL has massive room for growth. It is still very early.

2021-11-29 23:22:55

1/ $NGL is a üî• #metaverse n #playtoearn game with 10x or more potential.  Gold Fever wasn't thrown together to capitalise on the MV boom. Work started in 2020, first with the economic model, then the game was built around it.  Which makes me very bullish on the project üöÄüöÄüöÄ

2021-11-29 23:22:57

3/ -TOKENOMICS- Circulating supply is 12.4m making current MC 96m. Total supply is 170m but there are burning mechanisms and locking that will keep the circulating supply much lower.  44% locked for mining. Team and advisors have 20%, which is standard.  https://t.co/LWGoTjeKaW

2021-11-29 23:22:58

4/ -TOKENOMICS Cont- Token release will be gradual, by month three tokens will be less than double, by month 5 less than triple.  I like seeing a slow and steady release of tokens. That is what we have here.  Tokenomics are an 8/10 imo  https://t.co/4XC1t8AWqO

2021-11-29 23:22:59

5/ -VESTING- Good vesting is the mark of a good project for me and as you see the vesting for $NGL is great. A 3-month cliff means presale investors won't get tokens for 3 months. When they do, it's less than 4% per month. This will keep price stable and reduce presale dumps.  https://t.co/5pL2wstp2N

2021-11-29 23:23:00

8/ -VISION CONT- NGL wants to build a game that people love playing, which from the look of it, they have.  https://t.co/PrNgznuzEQ

2021-11-29 23:23:00

7/ -VISION- Many #p2e games being released at the moment were slapped together in two months, trying to catch the #gamefi hype.  Gold Fever has been in production for years. They are gamers first, and #crypto second. This means that the game is actually enjoyable.

2021-11-29 23:23:00

6/ -TEAM- CEO of the project Emilian is accessible to the community, which I love. He is on the Discord answering questions, and just taking part.  The team is huge, with over 50 employees globally.

2021-11-29 23:23:01

9/ -GAMEPLAY- The whitepaper does a great job of explaining the gameplay. The basics are that the game is divided into mining claims. Each claim holds gold and there are PvP battles for the gold. More in the WP   https://t.co/gfLcFtZjMM  https://t.co/QqKo68MpMX

2021-11-29 23:23:02

10/ -COMING UP- BETA is out in a few days, which is huge news.  https://t.co/YHsZwUobLv

2021-11-29 23:23:03

13/ -SOURCES- @ChrisRomanoC made my life easy with his detailed thread and research. Credit where credit is due.  https://t.co/2Td0XjKGEg

2021-11-29 23:23:03

12/ -LINKS &amp; INFO- Website:  https://t.co/s6NXwXQ5Yo CMC:  https://t.co/Qpzg6Gawjs CG:  https://t.co/jlOtCgEut6  Available on GATE, HUOBI, Pancakeswap, and UNISWAP.  Please DYOR on contract

2021-11-29 23:23:03

11/ -MY OPINION &amp; PLAN- In my opinion, it is only getting warmed up. I will keep accumulating on dips and doing my thing.  I want to be a major holder for $NGL, as well as a holder of land claims in the game.

2021-11-29 23:48:27

@mjasinek @hetshod @ChrisRomanoC If you don't read or do your research, you should never invest in anything. A cursory glance at FD market cap hardly ever tells the full story.

@sweetsinner3 üëç it's a long term hold for sure!

2021-11-30 08:52:43
