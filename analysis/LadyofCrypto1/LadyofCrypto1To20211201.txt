@forex4noobs It must be easy to criticise someone from behind, probably why I don't notice you...

2021-09-13 07:14:48

@MacroCRG Imagining how many people panic sold that mini dip only to have it break the days high an hour later 🤣 been there before

2021-09-13 07:16:05

@CryptoSharkNews What's next is that it shoots back to $46k before this article comes out 😂🤣

2021-09-13 17:03:29

@jasonpizzino What a difference a few hours can make in this game

2021-09-13 17:04:30

@MacroCRG #SolPunks are the $SOL flex

I see $43k #Bitcoin in the near future 🐻 #Crypto

@CryptoGodJohn Gains on short term trades put into long term investments is the way to crypto

2021-09-13 18:31:58

@DjPrestigeUk Because success makes you cocky and when you get cocky in crypto you get wrecked

2021-09-13 18:47:38

@CryptoSenorita leverage is simply greedy in crypto

2021-09-13 19:21:34

#BTC price action is 🤪 today

2021-09-13 19:25:59

@TrueCrypto28 $DOT $ATOM $SOL $FTM $UTK $ALGO

2021-09-13 19:47:12

@CryptoSenorita I am a bear today. Only because I want to buy some alts cheaper than they are now 🐻 looks doubtful now 😞

2021-09-13 19:47:39

@crypto_birb I bought this dip 🚀🚀🚀

2021-09-13 19:49:37

@foetzel77 significant portion of that volume was weak hands panic selling the dip

2021-09-13 20:19:33

I say $DON is climbing to $2 by end of month 🚀🚀  #Crypto @Don_key_finance #YieldFarming  https://t.co/413Oe4J4Be

2021-09-13 20:41:12

@NekozTek $DOT $ATOM and $SRM are my main holds for EOY, I think all three will 🚀🚀🚀🚀

2021-09-13 20:46:45

@blockchainedbb slippage 😱

2021-09-13 20:51:21

@CryptoTony__ As a friend of mine always tells me (but I struggle to follow) "the best traders know when to sit on their hands"

2021-09-13 20:53:58

@NekozTek another touch of $50 wouldnt surprise me

2021-09-13 20:58:19

@NekozTek it would not be bullish short term, but I am not ruling it out 😉 I am accumalating $DOT as long as it goes down

2021-09-13 20:59:53

@NekozTek meant AVAX oops

2021-09-13 21:10:42

@blockchainedbb @michael_saylor  is the boy who cried bull

2021-09-13 21:32:11

$ATOM about to ATH 🚀🚀🚀

2021-09-13 21:38:33

@JJcycles I need more dip that just this

2021-09-13 21:39:28

@NekozTek WTH LTC is usually the slowest kid in the race

2021-09-13 21:40:01

@NekozTek This will be the reason  https://t.co/efRFwAn3hm

2021-09-13 21:43:36

Sold all my $LTC the other day, masterfully played by me 😢 #LTC #Litecoin #Crypto

2021-09-13 21:44:20

@NekozTek I literally sold all LTC a weeks ago

2021-09-13 21:46:10

@ltc_angel And it will be ready by October 1st 😲 Walmart is the worlds largest company This is true mass adoption

2021-09-13 21:47:14

@NekozTek I bought it because paypal was meant to integrate and sold because its excruciatingly slow to do anything. Kind of like the boomers who own it. Silly me

2021-09-13 21:50:23

@blockchainedbb its because walmart announced they will accept LTC for online purchases

2021-09-13 22:04:22

@NekozTek Unclear but Reuters wrote about it   https://t.co/WXMYT3WREU

2021-09-13 22:06:36

@Thecryptomist leverage is greed in crypto

2021-09-13 22:07:03

@intocryptoverse even reuters put it up

2021-09-13 22:10:25

@MacroCRG love crypto

2021-09-13 22:13:07

@MacroCRG the chop today has been unreal

2021-09-13 22:28:05

@NekozTek and we see $50, and I buy :)

2021-09-13 22:31:30

@MacroCRG I do not believe it will bottom here

2021-09-14 02:08:59

@JJcycles today makes me think down 🐻

2021-09-14 02:12:45

@blockchainedbb alts being destroyed is musc to my ears 😋 I want some cheap buys

2021-09-14 02:19:41

@CardaxDEX your tokenomics are unappealing 😑 $0.50 per token with ten times the supply of adax which is $1 per token

2021-09-14 03:25:35

@MacroCRG bone-in rib-eye?

2021-09-14 04:07:16

@inmortalcrypto been on adax since $0.40 🚀I see $20 in its future

$48.78 $AVAX buy post the $LTC fake news crash will be my greatest move of the week

2021-09-14 05:52:08

@MuroCrypto I expect it too, but 43.5 is hard for bears to break 🐻🐻beginning to think we wont see 42

2021-09-14 05:55:00

@blockchainedbb rather an annoying stop than a liquidated account

2021-09-14 05:58:09

@blockchainedbb #cryptotwitter loves any excuse to complain. If you don't manage your risk, you eventually get liquidated. Period.

2021-09-14 06:02:12

@blockchainedbb I like these people. They kind of people taking the other side of my trades and getting me paid 🙊

2021-09-14 15:17:09

@thornythornydoo @CardaxDEX Insanely fast? Adax market cap is $53 million. At a similar cap Cardax will be worth how much per token?

2021-09-14 18:39:22

@diamondhandzz Smarter to hold both 😜

2021-09-14 20:17:51

Bought more $DON yesterday. I see it touching $2 in next few weeks (provided BTC doesnt dump) and $4 by EOY. Profit taking targets 1.35 and 1.75 atm  @Don_key_finance  https://t.co/gC1Bprp8HZ

2021-09-14 20:35:58

Golden cross on #BTC is confirmed. If it's as significant as the death cross then absolutely nothing will happen

2021-09-16 15:10:38

So happy #MoonCats dropping below 1 #ETH 😀I was waiting for a deal

2021-09-16 20:46:27

@MacroCRG @BuyBTC12 I am not disagreeing with this but a friend of mine always reminds me that "things are correlated until they are not" 😒 I hate the saying but the point he makes is that correlations like this one that come and go break so easy that its risky basing trades on them

2021-09-16 20:49:51

@MacroCRG @BuyBTC12 I found a wacky correlation with Chinese bonds and BTC that  lasted a bit and gave me some banging trades

2021-09-16 20:58:54

@BuyBTC12 @MacroCRG Timescale dependant a leverage scalper would care for this correlation more than a long term investor

2021-09-16 21:01:34

@blockchainedbb nasty and btc falls in tandem

2021-09-16 22:01:27

@blockchainedbb My take if anyone wants to hear it: Retail sales above expectations and unemployment up. Rich getting richer, the usual. People panic selling gold, silver, and indices to stash USD. AUD n CAD suffering, even more demand for USD. Bad for BTC.

2021-09-16 22:09:34

There is the correlation @MacroCRG mentioned in this tweet 😑 and the gold/silver correlation came into play also - bad for BTC longs

2021-09-16 22:33:13

@GainzyXBT People just mad because they're lazy

2021-09-16 23:33:12

@CanteringClark I too like it when my longs are bullish :)

2021-09-16 23:45:17

@blockchainedbb I'm not vegan but I hate that "you kill plants" argument or the "animals take up less land than plants" argument. The amount of land required to feed a cow is immense as is the amount of plants that "die" to feed it. maybe we should stop giving people shit about their diet

@blockchainedbb Everything is possible in this crazy market. We could be at 51k tomorrow

2021-09-22 00:02:58

This type of candle after a sharp drop is indicative of indecision and choppy days ahead. I dont think we see a decisive move in either direction in the next 72 hours, only chop. #BTC #Bitcoin #crypto #cryptotrader  https://t.co/R2RLxo0xtO

@TitanXBT Life is a flat circle

2021-09-22 01:38:41

@ChartSimpson CEO stepped down. I have been buying this dip. This sort of FUD doesn't last long

2021-09-22 01:44:07

@blockchainedbb Look hard enough and you will find a candle like that followed by a massive bull move

2021-09-22 02:23:41

@anewday1010 @scottmelker @coinbase Do you think that US investors aren't currently making use of services they are technically disallowed from using?

2021-09-22 02:25:10

@inmortalcrypto Why is the four hour candle important in this respect? What about the 1 hour or the 6 hour?

2021-09-22 02:26:12

@CryptoTony__ If they say they have a 80% win rate they are full of 💩

2021-09-22 02:31:28

@RCrypto77 @inmortalcrypto I look at higher time frames too, the daily. Choosing 4 hour specifically smells like curve fitting to me.

2021-09-22 02:39:44

@technologypoet I will teach you a trick that will make you money:  Set a rule that you don't buy more unless there is at least one red daily candle closed on the chart.  BOOM you are now buying dips. Maybe only small dips. But dips.

2021-09-22 02:41:17

@crypto_birb Show me seed for wallet please 🙏🙏

2021-09-22 02:49:48

@nic__carter Are you saying they are lying?

2021-09-22 02:53:07

@TradingComposur First you need to learn to admit you lost which is where the majority of traders fail

2021-09-22 03:05:51

@blockchainedbb You are great but I disagree. Selling at a loss makes sense if you want to reinvest that money into something better. Sometimes the smart move is to admit you lost and sell so you can put that money into something else.

2021-09-22 03:13:16

@blockchainedbb Got you!

2021-09-22 03:24:45

@mma_muse @blockchainedbb I read it. Perhaps I did not explain myself properly. Admitting a loss and reinvesting is often more profitable. I sold ETH at a loss in June and bought AVAX. Did I need that money to buy AVAX? No I already had some AVAX. I bought more AVAX and it was a better play than ETH.

2021-09-22 03:26:10

@DawnGrazier @blockchainedbb If it's a gamble, then you should never do it. If it is a trade and you're following your plan then it makes sense. At least to me.

2021-09-22 04:06:34

@mma_muse @blockchainedbb I am bullish as long as Hoskinson can keep up the facade that it is better than its competition. ADA has world class marketing and the uninformed masses eat it up. In reality ADA is outclassed by its competition.

2021-09-22 04:10:55

@technologypoet Are you not entertained?

2021-09-22 04:18:33

@mma_muse @blockchainedbb Fundamental issues I have with ADA: - Slow to get anything done. They are outpaced by comp. - Plutus programming language isn't commonly used which makes programming dapps more difficult. Trying to find a plutus developer is harder. Great for Plutus devs but bad for dapp dev.

2021-09-22 04:22:51

@mma_muse @blockchainedbb - Transactions per second and transaction time are both lower than competition. - Staking returns suck compared to competition, but this could change. - They pay millions to a marketing firm that is well known for manipulating news. Also known for making CEOs look good.

2021-09-22 04:23:19

@mma_muse @blockchainedbb I am bullish on cardano but I don't believe it is the future

2021-09-22 04:24:21

@CanteringClark 40k is support until it is resistance

2021-09-22 04:29:55

@mma_muse @blockchainedbb And this is the fundamental problem with Cardano. Hydra will make it better, but when? A few years. By that time the competition will be miles ahead once more. They move so slow. The marketing says "they move slow but they do the job right". Maybe.

2021-09-22 04:40:52

@mma_muse @blockchainedbb No problem 🙂 thanks for listening

2021-09-22 04:56:27

2021-09-25 03:22:17

@CanteringClark They make money on every trade, and the worst (or best?) ones at their job take far more than they should. It is one of the easiest businesses in the world. How does one ever go bankrupt is the question?

@wheresdaburgers @ADACryptoPunks Good boy.

2021-09-27 03:03:04

Say hello to my fav @ADACryptoPunks 😍😍😍 I just minted him  https://t.co/KBinDKSAwj

2021-09-27 04:19:34

@wheresdaburgers @ADACryptoPunks I will hold for a while

2021-09-27 04:42:08

@futrii Followers are less important that being honest about what you see. All the permabulls get more followers but their lying costs people money.

2021-09-27 04:42:50

@thecrypto_dave If they are the third largest they can afford to hodl where others cant

2021-09-27 04:43:22

@Mr_Raj_Gill Being useless?

2021-09-27 04:45:31

@scottmelker If you bought every time China banned crypto you would be a billionaire

2021-09-27 04:49:08

@futrii Agree. It is really sad. These influencers are just making money by fooling people into following. The amount big influencers are paid to shill crap pump and dump coins is staggering

2021-09-27 04:56:57

@futrii I followed you because you seemed honest and realistic ☺️ I've been trading for 5 years so I know enough to see that! Keep up the good work, we need it in this industry!

2021-09-27 05:06:53

@futrii Not 5 years of crypto, I did not explain that properly. Stocks before this and crypto is coming on 2 years.  I have not met many people yet, but I am sure I will now that I am on crypto twitter!

2021-09-27 05:20:01

@wheresdaburgers Eco and Adax are two crypto gems that I believe will be huge but not deep in nfts

2021-09-27 05:25:45

@wheresdaburgers Adax is on exmarkets @finance_eco

2021-10-02 03:17:03

$VRA @verasitytech is the most exciting project I've seen in a long time, big thanks to @futrii for the heads-up on it. Bought at 0.027 few days ago for a long term hold. Buying more now since price is still good!

2021-10-02 03:54:20

@IAMLLUCIANA That's rough for the people in it ☹️

2021-10-02 03:57:44

@IAMLLUCIANA Part of me wants to be mature. The other part wants to find the shills and watch this drama unfold, I AM TORN

2021-10-02 04:06:29

@dougboneparth #cryptotwitter is fickle

2021-10-02 04:14:33

@MacroCRG Just a little trend line break and clean bounce from 200 MA

2021-10-02 04:15:49

@MacroCRG Love it. Rare or blue or gtfo

2021-10-02 04:18:32

@AltcoinGordon Tell them to ape in a few bill please

2021-10-02 04:19:12

@gemsays Old man doesn't get crypto

2021-10-02 04:22:56

I am afraid to sleep tonight because Asia might turn this #BTC run around while I sleep 😨😨

2021-10-02 04:29:58

@CanteringClark Everyone's got a plan until they get punched in the face. I plan, and I execute, but this market is so dynamic that I find myself having to tweak the plan on each trade much more than I would in stock and fx.

2021-10-02 04:30:49

@dbeckara You are right. The prophecy cannot be fulfilled if I don't go to sleep.

2021-10-02 04:32:46

$SPX had a lovely bounce today. Government shutdown averted and it turned around. I won't say we haven't topped out but we might not have topped out. Weeks of range incoming? #stocks

2021-10-02 04:33:23

@TitanXBT  https://t.co/K7Z6UT63TO

2021-10-02 04:46:09

My trading plans simple. Build large positions in #cryptos  I like by buying support and taking partial profits at resistance. #Crypto is dynamic, plans change. This is my #BTC plan for now.  TP at $48.2k TP at $52.2k buy dip to $48.5k TP at $57.2k buy dip to $52.5k

2021-10-02 04:46:10

I don't always get my dip so sometimes I compromise and buy back more expensive than I wanted to. This plan is loose and will update with market changes

2021-10-02 04:49:29

@CanteringClark Very similar to mine. I am very wary of 50k that I am cautiously taking some profit well before at 48k-49k.

2021-10-02 04:50:02

This is the kind of analysis I love to see on CT

2021-10-02 04:53:41

@Nakamotolisk I come from stocks so BTC spot is plenty fine for me. I want to own my coins so I buy spot and store in my wallet. This isn't real trading its a mix of trading and investing. I want to build up my BTC holdings and I do this by buying dips and selling resistance

2021-10-02 04:55:38

@28O81364528 @CanteringClark If you had 17% chance to die if you left your house, you would never leave your house.

2021-10-02 05:00:01

@futrii @sweetsinner3 @DogeGirly Back from holiday so no alcohol for two weeks while I get back into shape 😢 I will join you in spirit

2021-10-02 05:37:15

@CanteringClark made a very good tweet here. I wanted to share my thoughts on this but as its a wall of text I didnt want to leave it as comments.   https://t.co/EuVWFDPwrs  I see a major flaw with the argument. Every month is being given equal weighting. 1/5

2021-10-02 05:37:16

In trading, every month is not equal. The summer period is generally marked by very low volatility. The Easter period, not as much, but it can be. The Christmas period is particularly low volatility, but can from time to time have violent spikes.  2/5

2021-10-02 05:37:17

So, looking at every month when assessing if the low set in the first few days hold, it introduces a lot of bad data. The better way to approach this would be to see if the low set in the first few days of October holds. 4/5

2021-10-02 05:37:17

If I wanted to predict October volatility in stocks, I would not look at the yearly average because  the months mentioned in the tweet above would drag that average down. I would focus on the average for October for the last 10 years. This would be more accurate 3/5

2021-10-02 05:37:18

Yes = Low set in first few days held until end of October. No = Low set in first few days did not hold until end of October.  2020 yes 2019 no 2018 no 2017 yes 2016 yes 2015 yes 2014 no 2013 yes 2012 no  This is as far back as my charts go but its 50%

2021-10-02 05:39:27

@CanteringClark I like your tweet but there is a flaw with your argument. I responded here since it was a wall of text so I thought a thread was better  https://t.co/eQPGWvr1JP

2021-10-02 05:41:30

@CanteringClark Awesome, I wrote all this before I saw that. Seems like Octobers are 50/50, so the odds are much higher that it will hold.

2021-10-02 05:41:48

@CanteringClark Thanks

2021-10-02 06:24:35

@motacrypto @verasitytech @futrii Will research this in the morning

2021-10-02 07:01:15

@trader1sz @futrii Two on one. Behave.

2021-10-02 07:05:44

@trader1sz @futrii He is too simple. This is why women are better traders.

2021-10-02 07:07:23

@trader1sz @Swansonflows @jimtalbot @abetrade You need to hunt them because they actively try and avoid you

2021-10-02 07:08:30

@trader1sz @futrii I made him agree, he is on the ropes.

2021-10-02 07:11:14

@futrii @trader1sz Scythes dont interest me, no matter how hard they swing, so he is out of luck 🏳️‍🌈

2021-10-02 07:14:39

@trader1sz @futrii Women are scarier than men. All men can be tamed. They present no challenge.

2021-10-02 07:16:31

@trader1sz @futrii The dumber they are the longer it takes. I feel this one will take weeks.

2021-10-02 07:30:28

@trader1sz Adjusting them is half the fun. Less adjusting in crypto than forex at least.

2021-10-02 07:34:35

@edwardmorra_btc Needs to crush 50k or it goes back into the range

2021-10-02 07:40:10

GN #cryptotwitter. Will leave you lovely people with an unpopular opinion. If #BTC doesn't smash 50k soon the it goes back home to the range. Asia shift be helpful for once and get us to 52k thanks.

2021-10-06 22:49:50

Haven't listened to this podcast yet but the book is so good I'm sure the podcast is amazing. Can't wait to listen.

2021-10-06 23:01:03

@CryptomuckerB @reserveprotocol Okay I will SENT IT then you say thanks

2021-10-07 00:08:49

@1billiondollarz Tell them to pump $VRA

2021-10-07 00:15:54

@motacrypto @BullBearBreeder Exactly. I was short term bearish on BTC and long term bullish. I have said that many times on here. My short term bearish target was $38k, which was not met. Does not matter. I have been buying alts anyway and sharing my buys.

2021-10-07 00:16:45

@1billiondollarz Not worried just want to get lambo quicker

2021-10-07 00:18:33

2021-10-07 01:03:20

@kaladinbtc Fair. Sorry 😔 I like to make dumb jokes.

2021-10-07 01:35:07

@cryptopunker13 Both. Always both.

2021-10-07 01:39:40

@AltcoinGordon If you listen to people, there will be an economic collapse every month. It's like Peter Schiff. That man has predicted 38 of the last 3 recessions. I agree. Governments will just keep kicking it down the road until there's no road left.

2021-10-07 01:40:19

@blockchainedbb All in good time

2021-10-07 02:19:48

@AltcoinGordon If Cardano goes to $1k I can buy #cryptotwitter and shut it down. It is my life ambition, truth be told.

2021-10-07 02:21:00

@StrongHedge Nice form. Proper impressive.

2021-10-07 02:25:35

@ThinkingUSD The paper it's printed on is

2021-10-07 03:30:34

@cryptohobbes @Mr_Raj_Gill Chill bro it's only a couple of 6,000 up

2021-10-07 03:37:40

@CryptoMWizards 70% are calling it a bullish trend 30% are calling it an upwards sloping bearish trend

2021-10-07 03:40:10

@cryptohobbes @Mr_Raj_Gill Yeah, just like a million cents or something

2021-10-07 03:43:15

@CryptoWhale Sorry to hear you fell over 😢

2021-10-07 03:43:57

@CryptoMWizards Close the day above 54k we are bullish Close the week above 54k we are very bullish

2021-10-07 03:45:18

@crypto_emu @CryptoMWizards The bears are just hedging their shorts too hard, thats what it is

2021-10-07 03:47:00

#Bitcoin IS NOT BULLISH!  This is an upwards sloping bearish trend. Bears are hedging their shorts really hard. #BTC #crypto #cryptotwitter

2021-10-07 03:48:31

@CryptoMWizards @crypto_emu You know the game!

2021-10-07 03:50:14

@crypto_emu @CryptoMWizards Same and especially if they do it through the ATH 🚀

2021-10-07 03:52:10

@sweetsinner3 You say it, I buy it, my new rule

2021-10-07 03:55:01

@sweetsinner3 You take nothing I say as financial advice

2021-10-07 03:55:15

@sweetsinner3 But I take everything you say as financial advice

2021-10-07 03:57:34

@AltcoinGordon Just answered this question for somebody else  They are saying BTC is not bullish. We are in an upwards sloping bearish trend. Bears are hedging their shorts causing a steep bearish trend which will slope down soon.

2021-10-07 03:58:20

@crypto_emu @CryptoMWizards 🤣

2021-10-07 03:58:54

@CryptoMWizards @crypto_emu I dont want to ever be the person who says   This is the last time we see 40k.  Only to have the tweet thrown in her face two weeks later haha

2021-10-07 04:04:03

@CryptoMWizards @crypto_emu This is how I operate. I have my bias, but I try to not let it impact my trading.

2021-10-07 04:08:05

@xbtmexico Masterful move. You will be rewarded.

2021-10-07 04:24:20

@Goodland_UK Did you make the best of the dip?

2021-10-07 05:43:01

@UrbanoCrypto I am not sure if you are taking my tweet seriously or playing along 😂

2021-10-07 05:46:50

@E45crypto They really are not fun in such a bearish market

2021-10-07 05:47:06

@Markonichiwa @InverseBull Where are you getting the drug dealer thing from? I love me some juicy gossip

2021-10-11 21:54:06

@Helloimmorgan Every Monday where BTC rallies is a good Monday

2021-10-11 22:31:07

@CaleCrypto @TheDogePoundNFT Same here, I minted six back then and diamond pawed five of them. I can't wait for the 10 ETH floor when the team does a party in Vegas!

2021-10-11 22:34:02

@CanteringClark I am no expert, but that looks sort of bullish!

2021-10-11 22:37:21

@Thecryptomist I like it when BTC goes up!

2021-10-11 22:37:41

@Bitcoinsensus Yes, yes it is

2021-10-11 22:38:18

@JJcycles No. It's possible but I think it's far to early to tell. It is a great guess though.

2021-10-11 23:10:58

@CanteringClark This. Trading is not about being right, it's about being profitable.

2021-10-11 23:56:20

@CryptoWizardd GSP is the goat. You okay though.

2021-10-11 23:57:48

@trader1sz I see a bigger retrace from 113.60

2021-10-12 00:00:47

@CryptoWizardd 🙁 MMA. Georges St-Pierre, greatest of all time. MMA community uses "goat" a lot. I thought you were referencing that.

2021-10-12 00:04:10

@Covingtcrypto @Crypto_L00n @CryptoWizardd Goat amongst drug cheats 😘

2021-10-12 00:22:05

@BobLoukas Crude is lovely. I am scalping short mostly. Although I agree with $110 or higher

2021-10-12 02:11:04

@BTC_Archive I wonder if the CEO of a bank has ulterior motives?

2021-10-12 02:16:42

@cryptofrog202 Genuinely excited to play ILV. Let alone to make a fortune from having bought in early.

2021-10-12 02:24:25

@Nakamotolisk @cryptofrog202 I just started using Lunrcrush and it says they have alerts. I am not sure what the alerts do. I haven't used them.

2021-10-12 02:24:56

@Nakamotolisk @cryptofrog202 Also. Do better next time, noob.

2021-10-12 02:28:03

@AltcoinGordon I don't think you understand inflation. Inflation is when interest rates get so high that banks stop printing money. Now because there isn't any money being printed it becomes more scarce and its value inflates. So you can't make more money because money is scare when inflated.

2021-10-12 02:31:28

@AltcoinGordon No but you can't make money because banks stopped printing it 10 years ago because of deflation. Nobody can make money. That's why we all trade fake money on here. Are you dumb sir?

2021-10-12 02:35:27

@Nakamotolisk @cryptofrog202 I know how chart alarms work 🤣  I thought you wanted news alarms.

2021-10-12 02:38:23

@AltsOracle I believe that dip was only on one exchange though?

2021-10-12 02:39:24

@crypto_blkbeard @AltcoinGordon If we are talking 50/50 in money or 50/50 in volume? Because if volume, you dead.

2021-10-12 03:03:25

@AltsOracle I' not sure if I follow the point then? The dip was caused by trailing stops. As far as I understand, there was a pull back, which triggered large stops, which triggered a further pull back, etc. Bitstamp accounts for only 0.31% of BTC volume. It doesn't seem significant?

2021-10-12 03:03:58

@AltsOracle I am not criticising, I am trying to understand what I am missing here?

2021-10-12 03:05:08

@Nakamotolisk @cryptofrog202 I dont think you could get ILV on tradingview back then anyway.

2021-10-12 03:11:45

@AltsOracle I like you and your tweets, but you're changing the goal posts. I'm asking what a liquidity issue with an exchange that's responsible for 0.31% of total BTC volume has to do with BTC as a whole. It is an exchange liquidity issue, not uncommon for small exchanges.

2021-10-12 03:14:57

@0xMephisto420 @Cryptopoulp1 @AltsOracle Bitstamp is responsible for 0.31% of total BTC volume. Seems like these are small institutions.

2021-10-12 03:23:07

@Cryptopoulp1 @0xMephisto420 @AltsOracle 😂The poor ones who shorted BTC at 30k

2021-10-12 03:31:20

Why do people care so much about this #BTC spike down on Bitstamp? Bitstamp is responsible for 0.31% of BTC volume. It could disappear tomorrow and BTC wouldn't bat an eyelid. This is an exchange liquidity issue. Not uncommon for smaller exchanges  https://t.co/x4hblV9o0T

2021-10-12 03:43:12

@0xMephisto420 @Cryptopoulp1 @AltsOracle Institutions buy directly through liquidity providers, not Bitstamp, you knob 🤣

2021-10-12 03:45:20

@AltsOracle Maybe I misunderstood. I thought you were talking about the Bitstamp wick.

2021-10-12 04:02:26

@Bullrun_Gravano If you can't handle a retrace, you can't handle investing

2021-10-12 04:25:05

@0xMephisto420 @Cryptopoulp1 @AltsOracle Sorry, I was not meaning to be offensive. This is just something you say jokingly in the UK. I say that to friends all the time.

2021-10-12 04:39:58

@AltsOracle @0xMephisto420 @Cryptopoulp1 That is hilarious. I really need to adjust when I am around Americans or they can get really offended

2021-10-12 05:04:19

I have 1,500 followers 🤯🤯🤯  I joined a month ago and expected that maybe 10 people I know would care about what I had to say.  I've made a lot of cool friends really quick, and found an amazing community.  Thanks so much #cryptotwitter for making me feel welcome.

2021-10-12 06:09:24

@crypstos @CryptoWizardd Agree. So many good gems shared here!

@Nakamotolisk @crypto_iso Talking down to men is the ultimate proof im a woman!

2021-10-16 15:34:20

@Nakamotolisk I've been lazy and not staked. Can you recommend a good wallet? I've looked at the list of wallets and I don't have any of them.

2021-10-16 15:40:19

@crypto_iso @Nakamotolisk I think you're in dire need of a talking down to 😂🤣

@LaertaShishman A very good idea. Market is weird and stressy, I need a break too!

2021-10-16 17:30:07

@eliz883 @CryptoTony__ Sounds uncomfortable

2021-10-16 17:47:08

@traderdaink They talking about that already?

2021-10-16 18:13:27

@JamEazy_NFT @modish_monkeys Thanks, it's my second. Just a new wallet because I don't like sharing my main wallet 😉

2021-10-16 19:53:57

@crypto_blkbeard Smart plays

2021-10-16 20:46:38

@modish_monkeys I will get it printed soon and take a pic in it!

@grimy_trades Ah shit, $20k tomorrow, shorted heavy

2021-10-16 21:45:29

@Maddog0084 @chanelegirll Full cycle? More like a fool's cycle.

2021-10-16 21:46:37

@Nakamotolisk First the merge, then the surge!

2021-10-16 21:51:19

@Nakamotolisk You can never time these things right. I take profit as my cryptos rally, and I always end up pretty happy. I have an ETH node, so I'm pretty exposed!

2021-10-16 22:05:47

@Nakamotolisk I would argue that if you didn't get out then you didn't time it perfectly. Getting out is the most important part 😂🤣

2021-10-16 22:12:27

@futrii @RookieXBT @loomdart Missing it 😔

2021-10-16 22:13:11

@Nakamotolisk Well that's even worse 🤣

2021-10-16 22:16:58

@Nakamotolisk It happens, I was just looking at some notes from February and I saw  that I'd put VRA down as a buy. I forgot all about VRA until I got on CT. If I bought in Feb I'd be way up

2021-10-16 22:18:27

@Nakamotolisk Every day the markets make you question your competency. However, if you are up overall, you are doing better than 90% of traders.

2021-10-16 22:20:54

@Nakamotolisk Winning!

2021-10-16 22:29:56

@Nakamotolisk 600% is phenomenal though!

2021-10-16 22:34:12

@LaertaShishman Omg were you a ring girl too?

2021-10-16 22:37:41

@LaertaShishman I was just kidding 😘  that is amazing though!

2021-10-16 22:44:37

@crypto_rand This is amazing

2021-10-16 22:50:27

@AltcoinGordon You sound like a dumbass

2021-10-16 23:12:42

@Nakamotolisk Fair enough. I just find that dwelling on those mishaps isn't productive. I try to learn my lesson and move on. Sometimes there is no lesson to learn though, markets just gonna market.

2021-10-16 23:22:05

@vojtek_milan @AltsOracle I agree. Blaming manipulation seems like bad mindset to me.   "My analysis was wrong but it's not my fault, it's the manipulators"

2021-10-16 23:23:32

@chanelegirll @blockchainedbb Great call

2021-10-16 23:23:55

@LilMoonLambo Where Joe Rogan at?

2021-10-16 23:24:57

@Nakamotolisk But not hodl them so long that they become bad entries!

2021-10-16 23:52:16

@Nakamotolisk Same here

2021-10-16 23:54:48

@vojtek_milan @AltsOracle I see it differently. Just a theory, but what if the bull and bear cycles of old aren't how crypto works any more? What if crypto has matured beyond the point of long and extended bear markets? With institutions finally here, we may never see those sorts of bear markets again

2021-10-16 23:58:48

@vojtek_milan @AltsOracle I'm not saying we won't see several month long periods of retracement, that's normal in all markets. I'm saying the predictable bull, bear cycles that we've seen for 10 years might be a thing of the past. We need to adapt to this new market now.

2021-10-17 00:00:47

@vojtek_milan @AltsOracle Just a theory and my opinion. I might end up being very wrong. I am neither long nor short on BTC so whatever happens I am good. There is too much uncertainty for me to be in BTC at this time.

2021-10-17 00:01:27

@CryptoWizardd Not heard of this one. Thank you. I love launchpads.

2021-10-17 00:06:04

@CryptoWhale I am not even a bull, but how many top signals have you called in the last few months?   This time it's different, I guess.  Or this time it isn't different?

2021-10-17 00:30:42

Maybe it's because certainty gets likes  but so many on #cryptotwitter are afraid to admit they don't know what $BTC will do. So, they declare with certainty "it's going up/down". The way I learned to trade is to prepare for both scenarios and not let bias get in the way

2021-10-17 00:31:50

@_ThaJustice @tradingview Well that's strange

2021-10-17 02:39:02

@Janisre Exactly that

2021-10-17 02:43:36

@vojtek_milan @AltsOracle Mature market is probably the wrong term. I mean the market is growing up. Let's call it a teenage market. The point being it had grow up from the previous cycles and will not follow those rules anymore.

2021-10-17 07:24:15

Important Lesson:  https://t.co/0RrEHrjog3

There are 3.2 billion gamers in the world.   Gaming is a recession proof industry.  #PlayToEarn games can truly decouple from #BTC  When crypto gaming gets going, if will make the #NFT boom look insignificant.  #GameFi #GameNFT #P2E #P2EGaming

@AltcoinGordon Cardano is going to flip BTC by next month. It is programmed. Sadly it is programmed in plutus, so nobody can read it, and it won't work out

2021-10-21 17:11:56

@babboycheif Look at the tokenomics, research the game, the price might look high but when its 70k yo will regret not buying at 700

2021-10-21 19:24:09

Liking the look of @CryptoneNFT #NFT but disappointed they can't spell "colour". They're spelling it without a U. No surprise given the rate of illiteracy in the US. Although, very Un-American to forget the letter U? Anyway, I'm in. @nebraskangooner shilled this, credit to him

2021-10-21 19:25:03

@LizV_Art Awww Chops is such a good doggo 😘

2021-10-21 19:26:23

@Cryptoingold Sir I dont think you understand. ATH means "adjusted time hopium".

@CryptopepperP ETH just touched my dreams

@nebraskangooner @CryptoneNFT How hard is it to spell colour?

@ltc_angel This is my life, don't make fun of me.

2021-10-27 05:34:21

@blockchainedbb Also the fact that it's a distribution platform/publisher and not a single #P2E game. For me this is the most important aspect. They will host multiple P2E games. Blockchain game publishers are like getting into Ubisoft or EA when it just started.... crazy returns

2021-10-27 05:34:58

@CryptoWizardd @divineanarchy Please stop shilling good stuff, I am running out of stable

2021-10-27 05:48:38

@yodatrixx @CryptoSavy1 Just depends on when you listen to who. If you listen to moonboys in a bull market, you make money. If you listen to perma-bears in a bear market, you make money. I don't listen to what anybody on Twitter tells me, I make my own trading decisions 😂🤣

2021-10-27 05:55:42

#PlayToEarn games, #cryptogaming tokens, and #NFTs are the most likely #crypto types to decouple from #BTC in an extended #Bitcoin dip.

2021-10-27 05:58:00

GN guys, it's been a great day for #alts   Will have more #PlayToEarn cryptos to share tomorrow  😘

2021-10-27 06:03:23

@ParketInsight Very nice

2021-10-27 06:18:56

Why are bears so sensitive if they are confident in their analysis? 🤣😂  https://t.co/jOonFURRK7

2021-10-27 06:21:26

@mikealfred Last two ATH breaks resulted in a pretty significant retrace. Not surprised it's happening again. It is definitely a buy the dip situation

2021-10-27 06:26:21

@trader1sz Your analysis deserves no criticism though

2021-10-27 06:27:32

@TheCryptoLark Probably nothing.

2021-10-27 06:28:07

Probably nothing

2021-10-27 06:29:28

@hodlberry I think you are the one who feels bad for missing the boat

2021-10-27 06:31:54

@cryptodude999 Probably but a lot of dexs launching Nov and Dec might give it a boost

2021-10-27 06:38:58

@nebraskangooner This is roughly my game plan but I have a bit more exposure. I think we are due a correction correction. Last two ATH breaks resulted in corrections. I want to be able to buy alts cheaper if that happens. I hope I'm not being greedy 😅

2021-10-27 06:49:23

@nebraskangooner I just keep finding good stuff to buy, that's my problem

2021-11-01 00:06:09

@CryptoTony__ So buy now???

2021-11-01 00:07:01

@ruigebilly I got in on Tech through Seedify launchpad, they do 2 launches per week at times. So I get into a lot just from there

2021-11-01 02:33:47

The first time I shilled PYR on October 2nd it was $7. I didn't have a lot of followers back then so not many saw this.  It's been a steady earner during October, but today @ZssBecker shilled it 🤯🤯🤯   Love it, easy 3x 💵💵💵💵  #Metaverse #PlayToEarn #GameFi

2021-11-05 23:25:58

Update on $NAKA, first shilled down at $1, took some profit at $5. Still holding most of my bag. Time to play the levels now. These are the two ranges I see, I will sell the top and buy the bottom of these ranges.  Long term very bullish on $NAKA  @NakamotoGames #Metaverse  https://t.co/pdlw8Dmx9z

@NakamotoGames Woah I just realised @NakamotoGames follows me. That's cool!

2021-11-05 23:34:59

Update on $PYR. Entry 7.30, took some profit in the 20s to secure seed. So bullish on this project, in my top three #Metaverse and gaming bags. Dipping below 18 so it's falling into the lower range. Just playing these levels. Break above 24 invalidates  @VulcanForged @VulcanVerse

2021-11-05 23:36:44

@EthuardR @NakamotoGames These are just the ranges I am playing. I doubt it will go down but you never know.

2021-11-05 23:38:14

For those who don't get it. I do not think $NAKA is going back to 1. I am just saying if it starts to dip hard. I will buy at 1. It's just the ranges I am seeing.

2021-11-06 01:17:36

1/3 9k followers is crazy.  This will be cringe, so scroll past if you don't want to hear it. I'm honestly overwhelmed by how many people want to hear what I've got to say.  I joined CT to plug myself into the crypto community n find some good gems.  https://t.co/if8waQdMVD

@Rager I completely agree and was going to respond to something PlanB wrote about this. It's illogical to assume BTC can go up 50% as easily at a 1T market cap as it did at a 1B market cap.  $500b is a lot of money, it cant come from nowhere. What assets are going to be sold to buy BTC?

2021-11-06 07:28:25

@metaversecapo @Rager Yes, I was wrong. I wasn't thinking it through properly.

2021-11-06 07:28:46

2021-11-11 07:31:52

@cryptochick21 You are amazing 😚

2021-11-11 07:34:31

For legit alpha, great technical analysis, and general awesomeness, follow @cryptochick21 she is great.

2021-11-11 07:35:09

@notthatmikeflyn Humor is the best medicine

2021-11-11 07:38:45

@cryptochick21 You deserve more attention. You are one of the smartest people on here 😘

2021-11-11 07:50:51

So he says "Oh wow I can't believe I am meeting the ACTUAL lady of crypto, and you can squat 100kg with perfect form"  I looked at him trying to figure out exactly what he was getting at.  He starts to get nervous and babbles.  "I am a huge fan, I read all of your tweets"

2021-11-11 07:50:51

I was at the gym today and I noticed a guy checking me out. No problem, used to it. He kept looking at me and looking at his phone, and then back at me.   So I say to him "what's up with you?"  He says "Are you lady of crypto?"   I say "Oh you know me from twitter?"

2021-11-11 07:50:52

"on what?" I ask  "Well I hold a lot of $ADA..."  I walked away and didn't wait for him to finish. I mean $ADA? Come on.

2021-11-11 07:50:52

In school I was bullied so I learned how to box to defend myself.   It really helped with my confidence and I am quite good at it   Where was I?  Oh yes, so I got into a fighting stance and fear came into the guys eyes.  "No no no" he shouts.   "I just wanted your advice"

2021-11-11 07:50:52

I say "cool... Well Im going to go now"  "No" he replies while stepping towards me.  I got into a fighting stance right away. I don't think I have shared this on here but I am a professional boxer.  It all started when I was six years old you see.

2021-11-11 07:51:46

@cryptochick21 Oops I won't shout you out again, sorry  https://t.co/glifI8mcsP

@Denis87042176 Bye

2021-11-11 07:55:49

Been wanting to see $RPG at these prices for a while. I am picking some up. @RevolveGamesio

2021-11-11 07:57:35

@PabloOnChain 💯 that is a nice discount

2021-11-11 07:58:31

@cryptochick21 Whatever you want I will do

2021-11-11 07:59:48

@DavidHarley15 Yes me squatting only 100 is a bit unbelievable!

2021-11-16 05:00:37

@MuhammadSaad112 Thank you!

2021-11-16 05:03:52

@frash_01 @NakamotoGames I do like the project. I dont have any ill will towards NAKA. I don't like how the hide tokenomoics info but it's not impossible to find. I think NAKA could be a good long term project.

2021-11-16 05:06:03

@Bitcephus 1/5 of the price much of the time.

2021-11-16 05:07:01

@RyanFarrugia19 Not true at all. Look at the chart image I posted. 20% dump after tokens were released. Anybody can confirm this by looking at their telegram and comparing times.

2021-11-16 05:09:06

@NakamotoGames @frash_01 Sorry but unless this has changed lately, it is not true. The only way to find them previously was to join telgram and go through pinned messages until you found the correct one. Which was one of the older ones.   Shouldn't there be a tokenomics link on your site?

2021-11-16 05:10:30

@NakamotoGames @frash_01 I have no ill will towards you guys as a project.

2021-11-16 05:11:58

@frash_01 @NakamotoGames I have no issue with the release. Naka had to release. They did a fantastic job with changing the release schedule. I know this seems like an attack on NAKA but its not. If anything its an attack on VCs

2021-11-16 05:16:30

@Bitcephus Getting a lot of money quickly is just a nice way to start a project I guess. I don't dislike projects with private sales as long as they have reasonable vesting.

2021-11-16 05:22:01

@CYBRPNK11 I have some of it but have actually not looked at the project for a while. Last I looked I was impressed by the platform

2021-11-16 05:22:22

@NaveenKumarK Probably soon. I am excited for the mainnet

2021-11-16 05:35:00

@Bitcephus I do agree though, it sucks that the rich get richer all the time. That's why I appreciate projects that don't do it that way

2021-11-16 05:47:50

@Adouble212 @polychaincap @AlamedaResearch @clover_finance From the start, Clover showed incompetence, poor communication with its community, and casual disrespect of investors. I sold long ago. It is no surprise they are thieves. I got a peek behind the curtain long ago and I didn't like what I saw.

2021-11-16 05:54:37

If you had to describe $ADA in one word, what would it be?   Mine is #stablecoin.  What's yours?  #ADA #CardanoCommunity #CardanoADA

2021-11-16 06:02:23

@LadyHanK @frash_01 @NakamotoGames Thanks Hannah!

2021-11-16 06:02:41

@CryptoMobsterYT Thats more than one word

2021-11-16 06:03:53

@CryptoAllyy Thanks Ally 😘

2021-11-16 06:13:02

A lot of people don't know this about me, but I am head of public relations at $ADA. I am just really bad at my job. I think Charlie is going to fire me 😔

2021-11-16 06:13:42

@cryptoshazzy @AshleyDCan She modelled for me

2021-11-16 06:24:25

@CryptoEmanon Why?

2021-11-16 06:30:53

If you gave me $5k today, what #crypto should I invest it in?  Best answer gets to give me $5k and I will buy the crypto!

2021-11-17 16:28:50

DCAs into $LYXE have been going well. It started its retrace on Nov 4 when I made this tweet. I've done three buys since then at key support levels.  My goal is to get my average buy in as low as possible. Remember always set DCA buys before support no on it. #GameFi #Metaverse  https://t.co/iSxIWdtHWl

2021-11-17 16:34:48

It is frightening how many people are all in on crypto and hold no stable/fiat to DCA or buy dips.

2021-11-17 16:37:38

@adilism1 Sounds like you are not taking profit

2021-11-17 16:47:09

If you want to survive #crypto long term, always take partial profit and reinvest part of that profit on the dips.  Not having stable for dips and not taking profit will get you rekt. Don't listen to moonboys or permabears, they will get you rekt.  https://t.co/PHVdCNy97j

2021-11-17 16:48:18

p.s. these are not real buy levels for BTC, just an example of what to do. Real levels are taking profit at resistance and dcaing at support.

2021-11-17 16:51:54

@BobS42008364 That is why you DCA into the dip. You will almost never pick the bottom of the dip so you DCA in

2021-11-17 16:53:13

@ElonYouri Don't buy the top.

2021-11-17 17:00:48

Either the strategy on my previous tweet or this one. #Crypto market doesn't care, either you feed or somebody feeds on you.  https://t.co/2qRO0mPGnx

2021-11-17 17:11:21

@trader1sz @andyy_typisch I make a passable women though. Just a few hours of makeup and tape back the bits.

2021-11-17 17:12:46

@0xJonny I dunno how America works.

2021-11-17 17:16:50

@trader1sz Thank you for the retweet. I agree with the technicals. You are decent at charting ser!

2021-11-17 17:19:20

@0xJonny Well that sounds stupid. I totally understand that people need to adjust their strategy around capital gains tax. I am not judging people who do not take profit regularly when it doesn't make financial sense to do so!

2021-11-17 17:42:03

@HukAleksandra Are they removing all staplers from the premises?

2021-11-17 17:48:00

Hey @cryptocom I will change my name to "Lady of  https://t.co/sigsnr28dr" if you pay me!

2021-11-17 17:59:16

@tradinglord I'll fade that action

2021-11-17 18:03:34

@Bitcoinponzi2 Wrong.

2021-11-17 18:15:10

@Nakamotolisk Not allowed to use the R word any more.

2021-11-17 18:19:34

@DeFiantcryptog1 @blockchainedbb People who don't understand sarcasm are a recipe for rekt at life.

2021-11-17 18:22:20

@wagmihodl OMG you are such a good button clicker in photoshop

2021-11-17 18:25:59

@blockchainedbb We hurting girl, who gonna save us?

2021-11-17 18:27:08

@wagmihodl Fair, I took a guess. The picture is indeed of a gorgeous woman. Probably extremely funny, talented, witty, and intelligent too. Oh and humble, I bet she is humble!

2021-11-17 18:32:23

@DeFiantcryptog1 @blockchainedbb I was in stocks before crypto. A 15% correction is still a crash to me. Don't get pissy with me on semantics because you are too dumb to detect obvious sarcasm.

2021-11-17 18:42:01

@DeFiantcryptog1 @blockchainedbb 100x leverage was sarcasm... the whole tweet was sarcasm.

2021-11-17 18:42:28

@DeFiantcryptog1 @blockchainedbb Why do I constantly waste my time with these knob lords? I need to learn to block and move on. Going to practice here.

2021-11-17 18:45:33

@IvanKukol Very photogenic

2021-11-17 18:59:45

@CanuckBtc @HukAleksandra 😂 great reference

2021-11-17 19:00:43

@karen_liekens @DeFiantcryptog1 I do a little leverage but mainly spot

@HardRockTrader @VulcanVerse @Jaap_NL_ NFA DYOR 😂

2021-11-17 20:20:07

1/ This is a rough break-down of how I played $NAKA. I did some stuff right, some stuff wrong. Some got me hate, some got me love. I was just being honest throughout. No shade on $NAKA, I think they are decent long term.

2021-11-17 20:20:09

2/ The first phase was the entry and rally. This was easy money. Pic below is from memory, it gives you a rough outline of how I played it. Example starting investment $5k. By the time the dip started I put 5k in and had 12.5k out. Maths done in my head, it might be off.  https://t.co/lbY97EhLv2

2021-11-17 20:37:03

@Adouble212 At this time last year BTC was worth 18k, now its worth  60k, we fine!  WAGMI LFG

2021-11-17 20:41:27

@Brian35985361 I am less concerned because I am in it for the launchpad and I have taken out my initial investment. I think they are bad though.

2021-11-17 20:47:55

@Des3pad I use the profit to invest in other projects or to put in my dip fund. My dip fund is what I use to buy dips

2021-11-17 20:48:34

@bbangbbangtan Then you are putting too much in.

2021-11-17 20:49:35

Just found this hot new watch brand that CT is sleeping on. Heaps better than #Rolex. It's called Patrek Phillips or something.   I just bought my first one. Only £50k, thanks #crypto. Blessed 🙏  How's it look on me?  https://t.co/tQJV5pQ66r

2021-11-17 20:57:20

@LillyLi85375860 Sure, thanks for the offer babe

2021-11-17 20:57:42

@ledererhouston I could do that, that would be fun

2021-11-17 21:27:43

@xrp_ninja Omg it's automatic!

2021-11-17 21:40:57

@xrp_ninja Eh?

2021-11-17 22:17:51

Do people actually believe $BTC is going to 450k this year?  https://t.co/6ebk371MMK

2021-11-17 22:19:29

@CryptoPoseidonn Eh?

2021-11-17 22:24:16

@waaves3 Arguably more logical than a 10 trill market cap

2021-11-17 22:27:34

@CryptoPoseidonn If you mean screenshots of my exchange, you did not read the thread. This is just an example of scaling out and buying dips. Read the thread, not just the top tweet.  You can look for my follow-up on how I played NAKA for an example in practice

2021-11-17 22:28:07

@MssMoney1 No, it's easy to do.

2021-11-17 22:33:11

@CryptoPoseidonn Are you even looking at the chart?  I take profit all the way up, not at every top. Half the time I take profit it keeps moving up.   I DCA into every dip, sometimes it keeps dipping after the first DCA. That's why it's a DCA and not all in.

2021-11-17 22:36:26

@CryptoPoseidonn If you have been doing it 10 years you know the importance of scaling out at resistance and in at support. Even though it keeps moving up after you take partial profit, it's better than staying all in while it dumps.

2021-11-17 22:38:40

@FreePeteRose @CryptoPoseidonn He just doesn't understand what I am saying. He thinks I am claiming I pick perfect tops and bottoms. I just scale out at resistance and in at support. It's basic. He probably does it too.

2021-11-17 22:39:31

@trader1sz 😂

2021-11-17 22:40:46

@Rebelshin @ZssBecker Will need to change his name to Plan D

2021-11-18 01:49:43

Two weeks for $BTC to hit $98k according to Plan B. If it doesn't work out, he changes his name to Plan C.  https://t.co/I0rAq3Y5z4

2021-11-18 01:52:23

@TheCryptoKeep14 Thanks I really appreciate that!

2021-11-18 01:57:08

@notalentcrypto I am just messing about, not throwing him any shade.

2021-11-18 02:00:57

@1QuadrillionEUR What is your prediction? When 98k?

2021-11-18 02:02:49

@dnice0123 I will never stop trolling. I am not throwing any shade at him or his models. I just thought of a funny joke and I tweeted it. If I think of a joke about anyone I tweet it.

2021-11-18 02:18:59

@Tazza_242 @dnice0123 Humour is subjective. If you dont find it funny you could always just move on. Let me help you out fren

2021-11-18 04:02:28

$RFOX up a healthy 40% since I shilled it just over a week ago. Honestly, I would like to take the credit, but my fren @CryptoWizardd  shilled it a few days later and really made it fly.  This is a good long term hold. Check out the thread below for a breakdown

2021-11-18 04:08:23

@thejosh21 I am already in a good position on $PYR having cashed out a large portion of my seed when it first rallied. I have actually been buying more PYR lately.

2021-11-18 04:21:13

@ArthurXi3 @VulcanVerse @Jaap_NL_ I am still in most of my BLOK. I am going to buy property. I am just saying BLOK is up far more than PYR.

$GAMER is a Kickstarter for #PlayToEarn and #Metaverse games. No brainer, I am in!  Private investors hold 40% of tokens and vesting periods aren't great. This means it could be a bumpy ride.   I am buying small now and DCAing in on the dips. #GameFi

@MuhammadAnasN10 It's a joke, not toxicity

2021-11-18 15:28:39

@TheAnonymous_ZA Not from gaming tokens. In game currencies have to existed longer than BTC, now they are just on the a blockchain.

2021-11-18 19:11:24

@jackson8800 @MacroCRG If it pumps great, I don't change my strategy based on my feelings, so it's the same for me either way

2021-11-18 19:13:47

@MacroCRG Yeah, who knows. I don't change my strategy based on what I think might happen. So either way it's the same for me.

2021-11-18 19:17:39

@jrthehodler It's something I am interested in. It's coming up, it looks great, company had a seriously good track record. It's one to watch

2021-11-18 20:55:34

@BTC_SCO1 Yes

2021-11-18 20:56:12

@DirtyDaveOK 💯

2021-11-18 20:59:41

@AltcoinGordon Aint good for your bags either. Binance listing is a dumpfest. Should beg Kucoin to add your bags

2021-11-18 21:12:11

@Flowyfiony @AltcoinGordon Yes, so if Kucoin says they are listing a coin I am in, it pumps, I sell before listing, I buy back on the dump.  If Binance says its listing it does nothing and then dumps. Trash exchange.

2021-11-18 21:36:37

@crypto_iso I am half way through an article about this.  I think gaming is the first sector to fully decouple from BTC. Will shill the article to you when done, would like to hear your thoughts

2021-11-18 21:44:50

@CBCryptoSoda @crypto_iso I will share it publicly. I was just saying that it would be nice to have ISOs feedback because he is deep in the MV too

2021-11-18 22:40:53

Games like CSGO have an economy built around loot boxes and skins. Secondary marketplaces exist, third-party gambling sites, charting and price tracking. Even this market has peaks and troughs, 2021 saw a huge pump precipitated by a reduction in supply, followed by a dump.

2021-11-18 22:47:02

While $BTC is dipping #Metaverse and #PlayToEarn are pumping this week.  Get used to it 🚀🚀🚀  Games have had full-fledged gaming coin economies since before Satoshi dreamed up #Bitcoin.

2021-11-18 22:47:03

Look at Runescape, the economy is arguably more complex than that of any #GameFi economy to date. It's had several periods of inflation and deflation over Runescape's 20 year lifespan. Chart below tracks from 2008. Source:   https://t.co/PCNSSET2qy  https://t.co/mjG7ptducl

2021-11-18 22:47:05

From MMOs to shooters many gaming economies are much older and more mature than Bitcoin, let alone new tokens like $AXS.  Game economies are perfectly comfortable operating independently. They don't care about BTC because the players don't care about BTC.

2021-11-18 22:47:05

I could give you endless examples of games with economies. Path of Exile has a booming black market earning some people hundreds of thousands per year. Which is nothing compared to WoWs black market, where the big players earn millions per year.

2021-11-18 22:47:06

When you look at a game like Illuvium or Axie, they may crash alongside BTC but I can imagine them recovering a lot quicker. Honestly, I can imagine a BTC crash not having anywhere near the impact on these two games as it would on many other alts.

2021-11-18 22:47:06

Don't get me wrong, though. If BTC crashes 30% today, I believe gaming cryptos would follow. We are not at a stage where they have fully decoupled. Many of the investors in gaming cryptos are not gamers, they are traders.  We might be at that stage soon though.

2021-11-18 22:47:07

We are already seeing signs of this over the last few days with #metaverse games rising while BTC dumps.  In the next BTC bear markets, I believe gaming cryptos will be the go-to investment for degens like us. I believe they will decouple from BTC like no sector has before.

2021-11-18 22:47:08

This is just my opinion, not financial advice. Do your own research and figure out what is right for you. Feel free to discuss below but be nice.

2021-11-18 22:48:55

@crypto_iso Here ya go, the thread I was writing  https://t.co/KeR7zrqgei

@iloveNiFTys Literally what this whole thread is about???

2021-11-18 22:59:18

@LizV_Art I think the ones that make games for gamers are the ones that will succeed. Identifying those ones is going to be a profitable skill

2021-11-18 23:02:28

2021-11-19 01:08:57

@ImIncoginto I really don't understand how you could think my tweet was in any way serious? Of course I got the pic from google. It is satirical.

2021-11-19 01:15:48

Been shitposting a bit since this $BTC dump but here is a serious one.  We don't know where this dip will end. Next major support is 53k. I won't be buying anything until then.   I won't blindly ape until things settle down. Dont be a dumbass  #Bitcoin #Crypto

2021-11-19 01:19:43

@crypto_iso Nasty

2021-11-19 01:23:25

In case I wasn't clear. 53k or until things settle down. Either or.

2021-11-19 01:29:06

@livefreerc @mariusporcodio It is not a criticism, it is a joke, banter. I didn't even say his model would fail.

2021-11-19 01:30:13

@mariusporcodio Why does everything have to be so serious? I haven't criticised him at all, I just made a joke about him changing his name IF he is wrong.

2021-11-19 01:32:23

@mariusporcodio Never said it would. I said it's the next major support.

2021-11-19 01:39:43

$HERO performs very badly for a #Metaverse crypto. I still like it long term. This crash is allowing me to build a bag.  The last tweet I said 0.094 for next support and its holding well today. I will be buying once things settle down, in no rush right now.  https://t.co/Vm3VkXzZpU

2021-11-19 01:45:40

@Rebelshin I dont see support at 55 and I usually look for support

2021-11-19 01:47:27

@Djeminsky Great With lots of salt You?

2021-11-19 01:52:51

@MacroCRG Don't be scared, in 2013 1 BTC was 600, today it's worth 60k. You will be fine!

@futrii @CryptoAllyy The longer you are in this game, the less you care about this. Partly because you get good at taking profit. Partly because you get desensitised

2021-11-19 02:44:44

@ethotaku @Nakamotolisk @spnoraci @Pentosh1 Seems early to me but it could be. I think if we see a true giga dump metaverse dumps too.

@JJcycles Not trying to shill my content, it just make sense as a response here. I think that we are seeing a decoupling, to a small extent. I still think if BTC giga dumps MV tokens will too, but I think the decoupling is showing early signs  https://t.co/KeR7zrHRCS

@nebraskangooner Analysis complete. Summary:  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

2021-11-19 05:31:09

If I told you about a #PlayToEarn project that has yet to be released but has investors like:  - Winklevoss twins - YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley - Manuel Bronstein CPO at Roblox - Zynga founder Mark Pincus  And a few more billionaires. Would you think it's going to be huge?

2021-11-19 05:33:04

@Plutus_NFT Is it? I never see it mentioned on Twitter, they have very few followers.

2021-11-19 05:33:40

@kajlool I mentioned a list of investors...

2021-11-19 05:35:48

@timmbitts Smart lad

2021-11-19 05:36:35

@Plutus_NFT Nah, not yet.

2021-11-19 05:39:52

@Plutus_NFT Thanks, I will do a thread on them tomorrow

2021-11-19 05:48:06

@lindacoindev I dont know, maybe

2021-11-19 05:48:59

@kozmikzambak 🤫 I am going to do a tweet thread. Don't spoil it

2021-11-19 05:49:22

@Stackin_Sats @Plutus_NFT We can't, its not released

2021-11-19 05:57:24

@MrSimplistic1 They started developing the tech before they decided to go play to earn route. So yes, it's made.

2021-11-19 06:02:29

@LunaCpt Haha it's really not that hard

2021-11-19 06:06:15

@KoKeVe1 Disagree but fair

2021-11-19 06:30:57

@MrSimplistic1 I get what you are saying but I have seen things, and this is more than that

2021-11-19 06:46:20

@jaldbazi_ Smart lad

2021-11-19 07:09:09

2/ It's not just their investors. They've developed revolutionary tech that allows you to embed AAA level games anywhere, like in this tweet, and you could play it instantly. No app, no download, no data intensive streaming like Googles failed Stadie. This is something new.

2021-11-19 07:09:09

1/ @theartieverse is the #playtoearn project I am most excited for.  Why? First, the investors:  - Winklevoss twins - Chad Hurley (YouTube) - Manuel Bronstein (Roblox) - Mark Pincus (Zynga)  When billionaires invest in a #gamefi project. It's got my attention. #P2E

2021-11-19 07:09:10

4/ They're a real game dev studio. The co-founders @ryandhorrigan and Armando Kirwin have worked in gaming AI and VR with Google, Samsung, ect. No need to go on about it, do your own research. They're as legit as you could get in crypto.

2021-11-19 07:09:10

3/ The big issue with many P2E games is that they look like they were programmed by a 14-year-old kid in 2010. Artie is different. They've been building for three years, their team comes from Riot Games, Activision, Infinity Ward, Zynga, Disney n more.

2021-11-19 07:09:11

6/   Details Project twitter: @theartieverse  Co-founder: @ryandhorrigan  Discord:  https://t.co/nU6oEhtpBm  Research notes  https://t.co/HqIZrIPEiu  https://t.co/utr0SGFXYk  https://t.co/DfSayTW1PL  https://t.co/rRlpUBMuX7 Most research from their Discord

2021-11-19 07:09:11

5/ Artie will be building more than one game. They are a game dev studio. I will be writing more about them in the coming days as I do more research. For now, I would just say, follow them, keep up with news, and get ready for when they drop their first #NFTs

2021-11-19 07:10:03

2021-11-19 07:30:17

@ultrastarter @GemSeeker5 @ZssBecker Yeah, he can really blow PYR up. Either way PYR blows up to be fair, he will just make it happen quicker.

2021-11-19 07:34:09

15k to almost 18k in 24 hours 🤯🤯  I was so confused until I realise @crypto_birb retweeted me n blew me up. What a lad.  Can anybody tokenise my follower count? Better performance than $BTC 🤣  Thanks to you 17.7k awesome people who decided to follow!

2021-11-19 07:36:00

@player1podcast @garyvee Yeah we are 10 years out from the MV. I don't think it matters too much. All people want is a playable game that they can socialise in or make money in. That is not 10 years away.

2021-11-19 07:39:57

@FreePeteRose @crypto_birb Actually, I live pretty frugally, 3k would actually last me a month. I like making money but I don't spend a lot of it. Even if I had 1 bill I wouldn't buy a Lambo.

2021-11-19 07:58:10

@JJcycles I think for now it's temporary. I don't think P2E is ready to break free yet. However, I think this is a shadow of what's to come. Like I say in the thread, many game economies are older than BTC and still chugging along. I don't think it's a leap to see them decouple soon 😊

@btxvision Capital. Most projects releasing tokens sell 30%-40% to VCs who dump on the market when they are 30x and crash prices. I prefer a project with tends of millions who doesn't need to sell to VCs. They are trying to build a community, that's the cool thing!

2021-11-19 14:49:34

@Justin_K000 Faith is not a sustainable investment strategy. Even if for some they had it and got lucky.  Also, believing in BTC is not necessarily faith. Faith is belief in the absence of proof. To some people, Satoshi's paper was proof enough to believe and invest. That is not faith

2021-11-19 14:52:34

P.S. Nothing to do with religion. I am referencing people who have blind faith in projects or direction based on little to no proof

2021-11-19 14:53:35

@Ketzum1 Why? If the totality of your argument is to say it's stupid, it's better not to say anything at all.

2021-11-19 14:54:53

@Altcoin_mo I don't want to offend religious people

2021-11-19 14:56:54

@Crypto_Apostle1 You are confusing belief and faith. Faith requires belief, but it is belief despite proof, or even with proof to the contrary.

2021-11-19 14:58:42

@Trader_Samfire Not bad, as long as you have the stable to buy down all the way to 10k. I don't think it will reach there, but I have the stable just in case.

2021-11-19 15:00:49

@JohnDoe78084921 @Justin_K000 I am referring specifically to people who believe in the absence of proof.

2021-11-19 15:02:16

@jrthehodler This is the way

2021-11-19 15:05:31

@Ketzum1 When I use the word faith, I mean belief in the absence of proof or with proof to the contrary. To me, what you have described is a belief based on research and proof.

2021-11-19 15:09:06

@Justin_K000 No. Look it up. Faith requires belief but belief alone is not faith.

2021-11-19 15:10:58

@Ketzum1 I am just going by the dictionary definition 🤷‍♀️

2021-11-19 15:19:03

Kind of want to delete this tweet because a lot of people think I mean "belief". That's not what I mean. I mean blindly believing in a project or a influencer without any proof or with proof to the contrary. Blind belief is not a good long term investment strat.

2021-11-19 15:21:32

@JohnDoe78084921 @Justin_K000 I honestly should have thought it through better

@ChrisRomanoC I wonder how long before they decouple completely. I think this is just a foreshadowing of the decoupling.

2021-11-19 16:14:21

@NikP68148569 @ChrisRomanoC I think if BTC really nukes Metaverse might too though. Just not as much and not for as long.

2021-11-19 16:14:51

@crypto_joey $500, need money desperately

2021-11-19 16:20:07

@NikP68148569 @ChrisRomanoC Totally possible and one of the best scenarios for me!

2021-11-19 16:24:41

@ChrisRomanoC Yep I've been witnessing it. However, we've seen other sectors temporarily decouple from BTC and then resume. So I'm not convinced this is the real deal yet. Maybe it is, I wrote about this yesterday, would love your thoughts!  https://t.co/KeR7zrHRCS

2021-11-19 16:53:18

1/ $BTC is dipping. I see a lot of degens are trying to pick a bottom and go all in. That's not how you buy the dip. Everyone tells people to #buythedip, but nobody explains how. This is how I buy dips on #bitcoin and all my #alts.

2021-11-19 16:53:19

2/ I always keep a healthy dip fund so that I can buy major dips like this one. Imagine my dip fund is 50k and I want to buy 5 cryptos in this dip, I dedicate 10k to each. You could dedicate more to one or less to the other. I am just keeping numbers easy.

2021-11-19 16:53:20

3/ If I want 10k worth of BTC, but when do I buy? I scale in at support or on breaks of support. When a major support breaks and price settles, I scale in. I might not buy every support if bearish momentum is strong, this is just a rough outline.  https://t.co/cvYp028Yxl

2021-11-19 16:53:21

4/ The idea here is that you are averaging down your buy price as BTC dips. You could make it more complicated by buying 1k on break of the 60k and 58k supports, then 2k on the break of the 53k support. Essentially, buying more the cheaper BTC gets.

2021-11-19 16:53:22

6/ Statistically speaking, scaling in or DCAing makes the most sense over the long term. This is not financial advice, do your own research, do your own maths, decide what works for you.

2021-11-19 16:53:22

5/ I have a plan to buy all the way down to 10k BTC and I will buy bigger the cheaper it gets. The argument against this is of course "well if I went all in at 58k I would make more". The counterargument is that you cannot consistently pick bottoms, no matter how good you are.

2021-11-19 16:54:44

7/ For those wondering how you find support on BTC. That is something for another thread. Although, most of the OGs here share their support area regularly

2021-11-19 16:59:50

@HSydneyHC Dancing until the bear market 😂

2021-11-19 17:23:31

@lvwHOO That depends on my goals and how much profit I took on the run up. I take profit regularly but I also try to build my blue-chip holdings. If I want 100k of BTC and I only have 40k, then I would not sell. If I have 100k and I buy the dip, then I would take profit

2021-11-19 17:23:44

2/ I have a trading portfolio where I do my day to day trading and buys.  I have a high risk portfolio where I am free to be a degen and ape into whatever I want.  My split for these portfolios has recently changed to  40 hodl / 55 trading / 5 high risk degen shit

2021-11-19 17:59:56

1/ I make fun of ADA but I actually hold it. I hold all the blue-chips. $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, $DOT, $ADA, $LTC, $XRP, $AVAX, $LUNA n more  I have a hodl portfolio that I hardly touch. I buy and sell some dips, but mostly just long term hodlin.

@aniprocs I dont like $BNB, I hold a bit in my trading portfolio but not in my HODL bag. I have VET in my trading portfolio too, don't consider it a blue-chip yet

2021-11-19 18:20:01

@deechopra69 Both ways are usually very expensive. Mostly through launchpads or by going in at a private investor level (100k+) and splitting between good friends who I trust.

2021-11-19 18:21:29

2021-11-20 00:10:23

@Jaap_NL_ I could do with a 7th, I am thinking vintage, watch to match my Patek.

2021-11-20 00:11:14

@waykewlstuff Yes

2021-11-20 00:13:01

@Altcoin_mo In alu

2021-11-20 00:13:11

@cryptowomany In it

2021-11-20 00:14:18

@waykewlstuff I am hot, witty, smart, funny, and most of all, humble.

2021-11-20 00:15:25

@Nakamotolisk @Jaap_NL_ @crypto_iso It's killing it!

2021-11-20 00:21:14

When you make money, it is important to be charitable. I, for one, donate a huge amount of money to a miners charity. $ETH miners.

2021-11-20 00:22:52

@tgpdefi Buy shit?

2021-11-20 00:29:39

@CryptoInKC In MC but got a shit entry overall

2021-11-20 00:34:20

@tgpdefi Heaps of stuff on ETH, the list is endless.

2021-11-20 00:35:11

@CryptoInKC I got 7.50 too, but not 4. I averaged down a little but not much. Noce buy at 4, that is great!

2021-11-20 00:35:43

@CryptoInKC That is a very valid point!

2021-11-20 00:38:24

@CryptoInKC Same here, I aped into that one on a tip from a friend. Usually, I am more disciplined. Had I waited, I would have bought near 5. Sometimes apes work out nicely though

2021-11-20 01:47:42

@decen7ralized Mam, this is the joke

2021-11-20 01:52:41

2021-11-20 06:09:49

@trader1sz @AvalaunchApp Launchpads in general are just money printing. BLOK launched from a launchpad and did a 700x at peak. Every time I mentioned launchpads on here people got no idea what I am talking about.

2021-11-20 06:56:41

@cruepto Thank you! 👍

2021-11-20 06:57:36

@EquilibriumTra @theartieverse @ryandhorrigan Follow them and they will announce when they launch

2021-11-20 06:58:19

@Starlord_75 @RaoulGMI I trust the projects he invests in, that's about it

2021-11-20 07:00:29

@trader1sz @AvalaunchApp Eh? I don't know what you are on about? I am saying I agree and that launchpads print money. I invested in avalaunch when you shilled it a while back.

2021-11-20 07:10:25

@Eunicedwong @blockchainedbb Who stole it 😞

2021-11-20 07:11:47

@TheResonance_ @trader1sz @AvalaunchApp I am not salty. I am not sure why people are misunderstanding. I am saying launchpads print money and most people here dont even know what they are. I got in thanks to SZ weeks ago.

2021-11-20 07:13:00

@Eunicedwong @blockchainedbb Thanks gorgeous 😘

2021-11-20 07:14:42

@trader1sz @AvalaunchApp I think I understand the confusion. When I said "print money" I meant they make you rich by printing money for you. I love launchpads!

2021-11-20 07:31:30

@TheResonance_ @trader1sz @AvalaunchApp Oh yeah they do favour VCs and it can really hurt a crypto post launch when VCs dump. My biggest worry with BLOK at the moment is the VC dumps.

2021-11-20 07:36:43

@trader1sz LFG

2021-11-20 07:46:29

@babboycheif @GameStationIO No, I only started scaling into gamestation two days ago. Not looked too deeply at the launchpad tiers etc yet

GN Degens 😘  Ironically #Metaverse cryptos have been in their own universe today. The up only universe.  Gaming cryptos will be the first sector to decouple from BTC!

2021-11-20 14:20:59

@NaveenKumarK They are both great and have huge potential

2021-11-20 14:24:27

@crypto_believa Not at the moment but I am trying to get that organised

2021-11-20 14:25:29

$ETH rhymes with thief. Think about it.

Serious question. Those who think $BTC is going to 200k or more this year. Where do you think the money will come from to push it there?  Not a criticism or debate. I want to hear your thoughts!  #crypto #Bitcoin #cryptocurrency

2021-11-20 15:10:43

@CanuckBtc Yes.  Ngl, I didn't care about following when I started. Now that it's flying up I am addicted to breaking those barriers. 20k is a huge one!

2021-11-20 15:11:20

@Malik_Farooq_01 This is not an answer.

2021-11-20 15:11:47

@cryptoyia I am not sharing my thoughts, I am asking a question

2021-11-20 15:13:00

If your answer is "that is what they said when BTC was $1k" just don't say anything. That is not an answer.  I am not starting shit, I want to know where smart people think all that money is going to flow in from.

@CryptoNewsUK1 Yes. I didn't go into detail but I mentioned either buying before support is hit or after it settles. If you are setting limit orders best to set slightly before support

2021-11-20 15:55:43

@nova_tnv Not a criticism, I wanted to hear people's thoughts, dumbass.

You can't be Queen of the metaverse without owning a lot of land. My #Metaverse property holdings have started with $PYR @VulcanVerse. Next is $BLOK and $ILV land. A few others I cannot mention yet.  Game property will be worth more than most rl property NFA DYOR  #PlayToEarn

2021-11-20 16:58:14

@p_arth_u @VulcanVerse I own rfox

2021-11-20 16:58:50

@jrthehodler @VulcanVerse What's affordable to you? I predict $1k for ILV land

2021-11-20 16:59:26

@JazzyGioGio @VulcanVerse It already is worth more in many cases :)

2021-11-20 17:20:06

@LancerDm1 @VulcanVerse I don't do paid shills

2021-11-20 17:32:54

@cryptooster @VulcanVerse I have a hodl portfolio with BTC and other blue chips. Why would you assume I don't?  Also, If you by cheap, prices do a 100x, and then the market crashes 95%, you are still in profit. I could say the same thing about BTC "has to have a bear market" 🙄

2021-11-20 18:01:52

@EthuardR @VulcanVerse I honestly sols all my NAKA and haven't bought back yet. I think the tokenomics will cause some serious pain in coming months.

2021-11-20 19:36:35

@EthuardR @VulcanVerse I am trying to time it well, I want to be in, just need to do it correctly. I am picky.

2021-11-20 20:38:40

@LukeZurawski @VulcanVerse No, not yet.  Vulcan is far superior because there are no VCs to dump tokens.

Out for the weekend, so a quick one for hitting 20k  I wanted to say thank you so much frens. I appreciate this more than you can imagine. It's silly but I actually teared up over this. Trading is a lonely business but now I've found a community!  Really. Thanks ♥️♥️♥️  https://t.co/UH65iWZKlG

If you're boring, like stability, and hate making money, you might be an $ADA holder.

2021-11-21 04:54:04

@Cyborgreddy Funny innit?   I can't hurt ADA price with my tweets lol

2021-11-21 06:23:06

2021-11-21 16:21:52

@CardanoPolice @Cyborgreddy Its shit posting, it's fun, I do it for fun.

2021-11-21 16:23:21

@jrthehodler Yes

2021-11-21 18:16:46

1/ JRNYs #NFT is crazy. Mint fee is 1 $ETH for whitelist, they're selling for 2.7 eth already.  Too late to be get on the whitelist. It was only for @TheDogePoundNFT holders. I am minting mine today.  I think they will drop in price the more people mint. Long term hold for me.

2021-11-21 18:16:47

2/ They're expensive, but in my opinion they'll appreciate as JRNY adds value.  This is not financial advice. Do your own research into these. Easy for me to be bullish if I am 3x up before minting.  Will share mine when I mint!

2021-11-21 18:33:20

@kevin_dmnk @TheDogePoundNFT I am too!

2021-11-21 18:33:50

@cardano_whale I make fun of everything from ADA, to ETH, to Binance. It's comedy. If you don't like it you can ignore

2021-11-21 20:56:18

@technologypoet @cardano_whale I get my followers because I make long tweet threads covering complex subjects. Not because of these dumb jokes. The jokes are just entertainment

2021-11-22 02:41:18

@ChrystalS18 I am negative about everything? I mostly post good content and gems. I make a few jokes about ADA, ETH, Binance here and there. You read one joke and send a negative message saying I am negative. The hypocrisy. 🤣

2021-11-22 02:42:07

@Hndsght2020 @beth_crypto I said way before I posted any ada joke that I was an ada holder. It's a in my feed. If you can't handle jokes, get off of CT

2021-11-22 02:42:52

@nicocryptope It's a joke, I am an ada holder

2021-11-22 02:50:56

@nicocryptope Hundreds found it funny, humor is subjective

@technologypoet @cardano_whale I troll the ETH folks too and I hold a lot of both of those coins. Its fun.

2021-11-22 04:12:51

@cryptoshazzy Yeah I hold some but I dont talk much about it because I was in the presale.

2021-11-22 04:17:56

Been a while since I updated $MC. I bought twice, my average entry was 6.24, a floating gain of nearly 50% but struggling at the 10 resistance area.  Plan is to hold and wait for a break for 10. This is a good long term #Metaverse play.

2021-11-22 04:22:03

$SHILL is at 80% gain since I shilled it. I just took out 50% of my initial investment. This means if my initial investment was 5k I just cashed out 2.5k  #playtoearn #Metaverse #GameFi  https://t.co/rN5bqW7Gxe

2021-11-22 04:25:20

Another $RFOX update. Up 71% since I shilled it, but we were up 85% at today's high.   RFOX bounced from the ATH today. I think its just a matter of time before it smashes through it and goes into price discovery mode 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  #Metaverse #playtoearn #GameFi  https://t.co/UbSFyhVx05

2021-11-22 04:26:56

@Robert_Klondike Weird flex but okay

2021-11-22 04:28:06

@JCtoyou78 I shared this days ago and it's gone both up and down since then.

2021-11-22 04:43:38

The first time I shilled $SAND it was 0.78, we're at a floating gain of 400% now, minus the profit taken along the way.  SAND is now pulling back and I'm going to reinvest some of the profit I took near 4.30, hopeful it drops to 2.50 at least but unlikely. Plan 👇  #Metaverse  https://t.co/kqYIqebLVA

2021-11-22 04:45:28

I won't reinvest ALL of the profit taken. I am so up on this anyway.

2021-11-22 04:49:06

@ultrastarter I have FEAR on my research list but not had a proper look yet. I am heavy into RFOX!

2021-11-22 05:27:51

@blockchainedbb @PabloOnChain I think it will hit 6 with the mainnet coming but token release next month will be brutal. Remember the higher NAKA is the more likely presale holders will dump because they are up huge.

2021-11-22 05:35:27

@yohan86771691 If it goes up it goes up, if it goes down I buy more.

2021-11-22 05:43:11

@cryptolee66 Nah some.od them are great but many get really angry

2021-11-22 05:45:00

@DeFiGod1 @Adouble212 The worst is all these VCs on Twitter with 100k followers that keep shilling their shitcoins.  One of them said yesterday that their shitcoin is a blue chip. They will say anything to keep their exit liquidity in.

2021-11-22 06:20:58

@Dan82979678Dan @blockchainedbb @PabloOnChain How would you know what I was waiting for? I am not interested in holding NAKA because I am in better projects.  I am just talking facts about NAKAs token release and how VCs work. If you are too stupid to understand this, that's on you. I was right about NAKA last time.

@TysonThe2nd P2s

2021-11-22 16:11:07

@AltcoinGordon Only choice. I tried to pay with ADA but nobody accepts it. They said no meme coins 🤷‍♀️

2021-11-22 16:13:28

@AltcoinGordon Sure, DM wallet seed and I will send it right over

2021-11-22 16:25:01

$UOS absolutely killing it. Up 170% since I first shilled it. Up 50% since the thread below, if you bought the dip.  UOS is one of my favourite long-term holds. I don't think its too late to get in, I believe this platform will be huge.  Wait for a dip! #PlayToEarn #GameFi

2021-11-22 16:52:41

@TraderDaink I am having a great day, I hope you are too!

2021-11-22 17:39:45

Side note, this is why you shouldn't ape a rally, and you should wait for a pullback.

2021-11-22 17:39:45

$LYXE playing out as I planned. I was a late comer, and I didn't want to ape in at 40. So I waited for a dip and DCAd in as detailed in the quote tweet.  My 4th DCA has been hit and my position is nicely averaging down. 5th and 6th dca below. @lukso_io  https://t.co/d3nWpS0FSw

2021-11-22 17:42:24

@ultrastarter  https://t.co/h4LozsuBoP

2021-11-22 17:47:19

I've shared #cryptos that are up 2x-5x. Whenever I update them I get people saying it's too late to enter. That's the wrong attitude. You aren't too late if you play it smart. If it's a long-term hold with good fundamentals just wait for a dip and DCA in.   https://t.co/cRZidVwTky

2021-11-22 17:49:22

@waykewlstuff @ultrastarter I am not trying to talk you into buying. Just saying that this isn't metaverse. It is a game distribution platform, so it will have MV games as well as P2E games and non crypto games. For me it is a different sort of play to my gaming plays!

2021-11-22 17:57:52

@TraderDaink Nice, Snoop was on JRE the other day, a great episode if you didn't catch it!

2021-11-22 18:05:47

$BTC looks heavy

2021-11-22 18:10:26

@upd_king Can't win them all, if that happens I leave it. Majority of the time apeing a rally will cost me money

2021-11-22 18:21:02

@CryptoMobsterYT @lukso_io Fair enough. I don't agree with saying "best" though. Much of trading comes down to what works for you. This is what works for me. Waiting for a downtrend would mean I miss a lot of entries on minor pullbacks.

2021-11-22 18:25:54

@CryptoMobsterYT @lukso_io *downtrend to end

2021-11-22 18:28:51

@honey_btc Yes, everything had been sold and put into gold

2021-11-22 18:32:21

I will yeet myself out a window before I ever add an /s to a tweet to mark it as satire.

2021-11-22 18:34:34

@JulioBReynolds No it's not. I don't respond to other peoples tweets spamming my bags.

2021-11-22 18:36:26

@drob3621 If you don't see a difference between creating a tweet on your own feed and responding to another person's tweet with unrelated spam, there is not helping you.

2021-11-22 19:21:16

@JulioBReynolds What are you talking about?  If you don't see the difference between somebody posting their bags to their own feed, and somebody spamming bags as responses to unrelated tweets, you are a smooth brain.  If you respond to people spamming your bags, you are a spammer.

2021-11-22 19:23:42

@ChrisRomanoC Thanks for the feedback and shoutout, I am happy you agree with my theory!

2021-11-22 19:49:03

@JulioBReynolds I shilled them from when my following was tiny and I keep updating them.   You can't tell the difference between spamming somebody else's feed and somebody sharing on their own feed. No reason to continue this conversation.

2021-11-22 20:29:22

4/ PLs only work because humans are trading. If the market were completely controlled by bots, they wouldn't work. People place limit and stop orders near to big round numbers, so when the market approaches those numbers, orders trigger and price reacts.

2021-11-22 20:29:22

3/ On smaller caps big rounded numbers can be more powerful, these are called major PLs. The smaller ones are called minors. More in examples below.   Why do these rounded numbers matter? Why is 75k important but not 75,182?  PLs are a self-fulfilling prophecy.

2021-11-22 20:29:22

2/ PLs are always useful, but they're best used when a crypto breaks an ATH and you have no price data you can use for SR. $BTC is the first example.  On BTC psych levels are every 1k, starting from 70k the levels are 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 78, 79, 80, 81. You get the idea.

2021-11-22 20:29:22

1/ Support and resistance (SR) is crucial in trading. Especially in #crypto where technical levels are respected. This is the first thread in a series where I will break down SR. I'm starting with the simplest form of SR, psychosocial levels (PL). #cryptotrading

2021-11-22 20:29:24

6/ This is an example of price breaking an ATH and PLs working well as targets for selling or for entering into a short trade.  I use PLs to predict where price will stall so I can take profit or where to buy more on a pullback.

2021-11-22 20:29:24

5/ Looking at $ADA as an example. The 3.00 was a major psychological barrier. When ADA was approaching it, most people expected a pullback from 3. So, they set orders are that level.  https://t.co/qw0HmKJB4i

2021-11-22 20:29:25

7/ Here is an example with $FLAME a #metaverse crypto I shilled at 1.10  https://t.co/GirprEN1WF

2021-11-22 20:29:26

10/ This is first in a series of threads about SR. I will break down more advanced SR in my next thread. I will then link all of them together into a super SR thread.

2021-11-22 20:29:26

9/ Plotting PLs on your charts when an ATH is broken can help determine where to set your limit orders. If you want to buy the dip a PL is often a good place to enter. If you want to take profit, a PL is often a good place to do that.

2021-11-22 20:29:26

8/ Here is an example with $GALA. Major PLs on GALA are 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 but 0.21, 0.22, 0.23, 0.24, 025, etc are minor PLs. GALA reacts at minor levels just before the major 0.3, 0.4 levels, as you see here.  https://t.co/x2CKETqZ2x

@Sam06674460 TradingView

2021-11-22 20:47:52

@PabloOnChain Very insightful, I agree, I got buy orders set at $0 just in case

2021-11-22 20:55:53

@Yash53500726 Look at the first tweet, PL stans for psychological level. It's in brackets next to the word

2021-11-22 21:01:02

@PabloOnChain 🤣

2021-11-22 21:38:35

@MacroCRG I love it when that happens

2021-11-22 22:01:53

@KJordash_FD I first started messing around in stocks 5 years ago. I learned to trade from a guy who has been doing it for 20 years.

2021-11-22 22:43:49

@crypto_bitlord7 Australia is mistaking COVID for a zombie virus.

2021-11-22 22:45:45

4/ I don't know if he is working with BAYC directly, but he knows the team, and he is a massive holder. Those sorts of connections are powerful in the NFT industry. I wouldn't rule out the JrnyClub and BAYC working together in future, this is speculation though.

2021-11-22 22:45:45

3/ Why do I think they 10x? Being one of the biggest influencers in this space, JRNYs NFTs are going to be popular. He will no doubt keep on shilling his NFTs in future, as he should, which will keep it popular. He also has great connections with @TheDogePoundNFT &amp; @BoredApeYC.

2021-11-22 22:45:45

2/ How do you get one? 3 ETH is a lot of money, but there's a chance prices will drop to 2 ETH or lower after the public mint. If you want one, either try the public mint or look for one post public mint on openasea. Just follow @JRNYclub for mint updates

2021-11-22 22:45:45

1/ I minted my @JRNYclub #NFT from @JRNYcrypto thanks to the @TheDogePoundNFT launchpad. Mint fee was 1 $ETH but they're already selling for 3ETH, quickest 3x I've ever seen. I didn't sell, because I think it will be worth 10x +.  In this thread I break down why  https://t.co/QdZ7pS6NHg

2021-11-22 22:45:46

7/ The roadmap talks about partnerships they have in the works. I am excited to see what they are but it would not surprise me if JRNY woks with BAYC and SAND. With the sort of reach JRNY has, he can forge partnerships with some huge names in the NFT and metaverse sectors.

2021-11-22 22:45:46

6/ JRNY is supporting community development with a community grant fund.  Future NFT sets will have 3D models that can be used in the #metaverse. The goal is to create the best NFT club in the metaverse. I wonder what metaverse game they are building in? My guess is $SAND

2021-11-22 22:45:46

5/ On to facts. As a JRNYClub holder you will get free minting of two future NFT sets. One NFT today become three in future. I don't know exactly what JRNY is doing with those sets but I have no doubt they will be huge. Collab set with DogePound? Who knows.

2021-11-22 22:45:47

9/ Last but not least as an NFT holder you get access to member's only videos from JRNY. I am sure they will contain a lot of top tier alpha.

2021-11-22 22:45:47

8/ The part I am most excited for is the launchpad. Launchpads have made me ridiculous returns. Only reason I got a JRNYclub NFT was thanks to the Doge Pound launchpad. JRNYclub will have its own launchpad and I am sure JRNY will be launching some quality projects.

2021-11-22 22:58:09

@CanteringClark Can't make sense of this market. Risk on, risk off, risk on, risk off.

@Mr_E_Graves @rocketbotpro This is awesome, thank you so much, I am flattered

2021-11-23 06:40:02

$BTC CEO needs to announce a #metaverse for BTC to break 70k. No metaverse, no chance.

2021-11-23 06:46:27

@PabloOnChain @blockchainedbb Amateur, that is way too high. -5 at least. 🤣

2021-11-23 06:55:05

@blockchainedbb You should have a no dumbass rule. Excludes 70% of people in crypto, but it'll keep you sane!

2021-11-23 06:58:08

@Lifeisgood1232 It is

2021-11-23 07:04:32

@LonelyBoyNFT @Mr_E_Graves @rocketbotpro I wish I had more too ☹️

2021-11-23 07:06:37

@LonelyBoyNFT @Mr_E_Graves @rocketbotpro That the problem with being sensible in crypto.

2021-11-23 07:11:43

I'd rather be early with $1k than late with $100k.  If you're not looking for projects that haven't been released yet, you're doing #crypto wrong.

2021-11-23 07:17:37

@crypto_birb Thanks Birb!

2021-11-23 07:21:24

@PrinceV97632318 Report please

2021-11-23 07:22:25

@cloudzombi I mean find promising projects and buy them when you can, either IDO or public release

2021-11-23 07:52:10

@cloudzombi @FlamestarteR Somebody linked me it today but I did not look. That sounds ridiculous. I will probably dump flame tomorrow

2021-11-23 07:52:44

@IcebergSimpson Research. I might do a thread on this.

2021-11-23 07:56:28

@kintsugigarage Not true at all. I have had a 1000x and a 700x return, along with many 20x to 50x. I got lose money on the next 200 and still be hundreds of thousands ahead. Not that it will happen, as more than half break even or more.

2021-11-23 07:57:18

@2920315914lover Don't be early on ETH projects

2021-11-23 07:57:55

@crypto_birb I know right, I get this more and more since I gained followers. It's literally quicker and easier to Google it half the time.

2021-11-23 16:53:22

@cryptochick21 😘 It's a good spot to add, I am going to do the same today.  I am pretty bearish over the short term. I hope we see 50k, a recovery already would be boring

2021-11-23 16:54:42

GM Degens 😘  $BTC is incompetent. It can't break an ATH and rally. It can't dip properly. Going to speak with the Director of Price today for BTC and get this sorted.

2021-11-23 17:08:59

$BTC dipping. Portfolios red. Meanwhile, my biggest bags:  $PYR new ATH today $UFO new ATH yesterday $RFOX new 6 month high yesterday  Smaller bags pumping too. Closing in on 7 figures. Hope you joined me for this ride team! #Metaverse n #PlayToEarn will mint billionaires.

@8888BF I think you misunderstood. I am saying do not read hidden meanings in my jokes. It's a joke, there is no hidden meaning.   I am not saying "do not read my jokes"

@0xJonny ADA is okay but its not something you want to be all in on

2021-11-23 17:29:38

@BitcoinerJimmy That is absurd. I never said that. I never told you to do that. I have held sand for ages and I never sold all of it.

2021-11-23 17:30:26

2021-11-23 17:53:23

@R2D2UK I know right. I was careful to explain it properly and stull

2021-11-23 17:54:46

@DLKCRYPTO Oh no. Do they want to create a node and then sell the STRONG? They probably think they are a genius for discovering that loophole

@ZssBecker These lists are disgusting. I lost instant respect for the people on it.

2021-11-23 18:21:52

@ZssBecker Except the ones who disclose, like JRNY, he good.

2021-11-23 18:23:16

@BumpyMary @ZssBecker He discloses though. I always knew he did paid shills. I don't dislike it when somebody says "This is a paid promotion but I believe in the project".  I genuinely think JRNY is a good lad and I don't think he would shill rubbish for money

2021-11-23 18:25:49

I am in this awkward position where I hate Zuck and FB but he pumped my #Metaverse bags so much that I am closing in on 7 figures in my crypto portfolio.

2021-11-23 18:26:14

@BumpyMary @ZssBecker Many of them dont disclose!

2021-11-23 18:26:55

@cryptocevo Not trying to teach you anything. I know a bubble when I see one and I think there will be pain at some point for those who haven't been taking profit. That being said, I do think play to earn is here to stay and will decouple from BTC eventually.   https://t.co/KeR7zrHRCS

2021-11-23 20:16:16

@microminnow What? I dont use telegram, that is a scam.

2021-11-23 20:17:37

@TouseefAbbasii I am not saying IDOs. I am saying you find coins and get in early. Even if its a public launch.

2021-11-23 20:18:53

@microminnow It's a scam.

2021-11-23 20:26:20

1/ All in or all out is the wrong attitude. I have scaled into #Metaverse cryptos and bleed out profit along the way. If they are a bubble, and they all crash 90% tomorrow, I'll have walked away with profit.   https://t.co/d2VFdDyuSN

2021-11-23 20:26:21

3/ I won't pretend I know when the #Metaverse rally ends or if it even ends. It doesn't matter. I have realised enough profit that if every MV project rugs, I walk away with more money than I started with.

2021-11-23 20:26:21

2/ In my opinion, this is the key to being a successful investor. You scale into the rally by buying the dips. You take profit by selling the peaks.  If executed correctly, you will end up with realised profit while still holding a large bag.

2021-11-23 20:27:17

@microminnow I am telling you it is a scam. That is a fake account, it is not me.

2021-11-23 20:28:33

@TouseefAbbasii I know. I am in a lot of launchpads. You can usually get in at launch for 3x-5x more than launchpad people.

2021-11-23 20:29:42

@real_jAces I reporter it, nothing is happening. Please report!

2021-11-23 20:31:36

2021-11-23 20:43:32

@cryptoaladeen Can buy mine for $7 a pop and keep the box?

2021-11-23 21:24:20

3/ You can find gems by visiting a LPAs website and looking for projects that are launching. You won't be able to get in presale if you don't hold the LPA, but nothing is stopping you from getting in after public release.

2021-11-23 21:24:20

2/ You need to be aware of vesting schedules, so you can plan for dips when presale holders dump. This info is on the LPAs telegram.  If you don't know what a LPA is, it's a service that promotes and launches cryptos. Holders of the LPA crypto get presale prices.

2021-11-23 21:24:20

1/ This is the first in a series of articles on gem hunting. I'll start with the easiest way, launchpads (LPAs).  Some say that LPA #cryptos aren't gems because of presellers price dumping, but I got a lot of good #PlayToEarn and #Metaverse gems for LPAs. They're 💎 imo.

2021-11-23 21:24:23

6/ Just make sure you actually research the projects before jumping in. Just because its launching through a LPA it doesn't make it good. Do your research to decide if the project is worth investing in. Don't forget to add vesting dates to your calendar.

2021-11-23 21:24:23

5/ Like any project you still need to do your research and make sure the launching project is a good one. In order to find launching projects you go to the launchpads site. Here are a few   https://t.co/gEm28QiJ8w  https://t.co/pbgyTbRFi1  https://t.co/qn1pDi86uP

2021-11-23 21:24:23

4/ Even if you do not get in at presale prices, the upside potential on many of these projects is huge. I would not buy on public release day as they usually dip after launch volatility, and you can buy in cheaper.  https://t.co/UwwgUheXSP

2021-11-23 21:24:24

7/ This is the easiest ways to find gems before they release. It's gem finding for lazy people. I will share more techniques in future threads.

2021-11-23 21:26:09

@cryptoaladeen I dont like watches, but I like money!

2021-11-23 21:30:27

@cousincrypt0 Buying all the USD I can. 1 USD today will be worth 100 USD when inflation goes out of control!

2021-11-23 21:47:29

If you follow a VC and you think they care about making you money. Remember, they are already up 50x when they are telling you to buy, and they will dump on you without shedding a tear.  I'm sure some of them are good people but I wouldn't count on goodness.

2021-11-23 21:48:34

P.S. Any time I share a project I bought presale I make it clear and I say when I am selling.

2021-11-23 21:49:31

Who knows if you can trust me though? I am honest but you shouldn't blindly trust anyone who is up huge and telling you they won't dump.

2021-11-23 21:56:36

@cryptocevo Loving your tweets today. I get asked for EOY predictions every day.  Making a prediction like that can only hurt your trading. You decide some crypto is going to 10 and it clouds your judgement when it tops at 5 and it's time to sell.  Also, like you say, noone knows

2021-11-23 21:58:53

@daaku100x Good

2021-11-23 22:03:49

@SpbRepetitor I was not a VC in most of them. I was in BLOK, ACK, and one or two more I can't recall. I disclosed every time though. You are right to be cautious.

2021-11-23 22:04:24

2021-11-23 23:28:33

@PTStenseth You should read the whole thing. I am not saying use a launchpad. I am saying to view stuff that's launching and buy it on the public sale

@itsmeace00 @FrankLambeek @verasitytech No I am invested in VRA, I understand it. I just don't understand this add. What is built on it? I don't get what they are advertising.

2021-11-24 04:30:26

1/ When I first looked at $LYXE I wasn't blown away. Big mistake, this #metaverse and #NFT crypto is an absolute gem. Now I have my second chance and I won't waste it.  I've shared my LYXE entries already, I've gone bigger at 17. This one is a 3-6 month hold.  @lukso_io  https://t.co/Mh92GS9fTF

2021-11-24 04:30:27

2/ Lukso is a #blockchain for #NFTs using ETH 2.0 proof of stake. At least it will be when the mainnet comes out. It is dipping right now because the mainnet was delayed. Delays are good, it means they aren't rushing out something that doesn't work to keep people happy.

2021-11-24 04:30:28

4/ Lukso uses what they call "virtualization" to turn physical assets into NFTs. This means you can bring something physical onto the blockchain as an NFT. This also means that you could bring physical objects into the metaverse.

2021-11-24 04:30:28

3/ It also means that paperhands have gifted me prices I thought I would never see again, thanks 😘  Why is Lukso so good?  First, it gives you an identity in the metaverse that you can take from MV to MV, even on different blockchains. Some other cryptos do this.

2021-11-24 04:30:29

5/ Lukso says it allows brands to create tokenized communities. Honestly, I find this statement confusing. So I did some digging for examples, and I found a few.  Lukso enables fashion brands to create and sell digital clothing that can be used in the metaverse.

2021-11-24 04:30:30

6/ At first this sounded weird, but think about it. Nike wants to release sneakers that you can wear in the metaverse. People are crazy about sneakers, ever heard of sneaker heads? Nike could create and sell those sneakers on Lukso because it provides the infrastructure to do so.

2021-11-24 04:30:31

7/ Fashion is a $1.4 trillion industry, so when it moves into the metaverse, I want to be ready. I believe Lukso is the on-ramp for fashion to the MV. In fact, it has already started with this digital fashion piece selling for 100 ETH on Lukso   https://t.co/cgPDKqpkIy

2021-11-24 04:30:32

8/ Fashion in the metaverse will be huge. Look at all the people showing of Rolex's and Lambos on twitter. Crypto people are new money, and if there is anything new money likes, its flashing gaudy stuff to show off how rich they are. There is certainly a market for it here.

2021-11-24 04:30:33

9/ The tokenomics are great, a tiny 15m supply until mainnet. 30% was sold in private sale, will be unlocked at mainnet launch. Which means things could dip at launch, but that is 6 months away according to the article below. Until then, no VCs to dumps!   https://t.co/JMxJte7nZG  https://t.co/I8aHcceRL2

2021-11-24 04:30:34

10/ The team for Lukso is absolutely amazing. @feindura author of ERC 20 and ERC 725 and lead dapp developer of Ethereum. @m_h_d_v co-founder of Dematerialized, creator of EY Innovation Lab. Along with expert advisors  https://t.co/q3r5uRC9Fm

2021-11-24 04:30:35

12/ I also heard that @RaoulGMI is looking into LYXE which is big. He is the reason I got into RFOX, another metaverse project I am in that is giving huge returns.   https://t.co/ZcX0wW8XbN

2021-11-24 04:30:35

11/ I've shared my plan for LYXE before. I bought a big bag at 17 today. I have some reserves to buy at 12, but I am not convinced it reaches there.  Do your own research, none of this is financial advice. I am sharing my plan and that is all.   https://t.co/KSxD5stU2C

2021-11-24 04:30:36

13/ Lukso is dipping, so after you do your research, if you like it, just consider that it can go lower than where its at now. I am ready to average down.

2021-11-24 04:36:05

@HSydneyHC 💯 ILV is one of my long term holds. Staking rewards are so good!

2021-11-24 06:15:58

@Cap1885 @lukso_io Yes!

2021-11-24 06:20:52

$UOS is an absolute beast, it just hit 286% from where I shilled it 🚀🚀🚀🚀  People keep asking me my target. There is no target, this is a long-term hold. I'll take some profit as it rallies and reinvest on dips.  https://t.co/oIaWoYxlh5

2021-11-24 06:24:34

@PEPC99 Yes

2021-11-24 06:27:45

Bull market returning to normal  $BTC up  $ETH up  $BNB up  $SOL up  $DOT up  $ADA down  Everything is as it should be.

2021-11-24 06:29:13

@PEPC99 I did not see her chart, its rallying, I don't see why you would start a DCA at the top of a rally.

2021-11-24 06:30:28

@FatCatDown Just pointing out facts 🤷‍♀️

2021-11-24 06:32:25

@Lifeisgood1232 Yes!

2021-11-24 06:36:02

@PEPC99 Sorry I got confused. I thought we were discussing UOS. DCA isn't bad at 45 and 32 like she says

2021-11-24 06:45:16

@cryptochecovf That is just embarrasing

2021-11-24 07:15:31

1/ $FLAME has changed its launchpad tiers.   Previously, owning 10k or 25k FLAME gave you guaranteed allocation. Now they've switched to some convoluted tier system.  From what I can make out only the top 25 holders get guaranteed allocation.  https://t.co/jwENQGmeW2

2021-11-24 07:15:32

3/ I don't have the time or willingness to dump another $30k into FLAME just to get the allocation I was promised. If that is even enough.  There are better launchpads out there with teams that don't randomly change their rules.  Closing FLAME with good profit.

2021-11-24 07:15:32

2/ You also need a Hiro NFT. What's that? Well, good luck finding out. There is no easy to find link on where to buy a Hiro. I heard they are 3 ETH but can't confirm.  Launchpads should be simple, and shouldn't randomly change rules to benefit whales.

2021-11-24 07:17:41

@_VLaaD_ @melozie0x @lukso_io Read 14/   Why do people comment before reading the whole thread?

2021-11-24 07:19:33

@melozie0x @_VLaaD_ @lukso_io Also you would sell because 30% of the supply is unlocked and presale investors might be up 100x. It makes sense that they would dump so derisking at launch and getting back in on the dip makes sense. Just my opinion based on historical examples.

2021-11-24 07:22:40

@bignosewhoknos @lukso_io @daddyjamesy 20k wont move the price will it?

2021-11-24 07:23:44

@alexandre_lores Please dont tell me I can actually cause a dip.

2021-11-24 07:28:24

@melozie0x @_VLaaD_ @lukso_io Oh yeah I would expect it to be much higher by the time the mainnet is out. If its back in the 40s or higher I will probably sell off a chunk before the mainnet. I think this is a long term hold though, could end up being one of the biggest blockchains.

2021-11-24 07:29:46

@bignosewhoknos @lukso_io @daddyjamesy @dematerialised I think I need to be careful with what I tweet maybe.  No I haven't, I will add it to my list for tomorrow, thank you!

2021-11-24 07:34:26

@Akiz16 It seems like I caused a small dump and the idea that I could be responsible for that scares me.

2021-11-24 07:35:47

@Crypto_holix There are good launchpads too. This is a bad example.

2021-11-24 07:38:47

@Special_Souce No, sorry

2021-11-24 07:42:08

@toby_w_p @lukso_io I don't know why, but I feel insulted 🤣

2021-11-24 08:03:08

@toby_w_p @lukso_io Yes I am

2021-11-24 08:04:48

@cloudzombi That's a useful place to have the link. A more useful place would be on their actual website on the page dedicated to NFTs. The incompetence is staggering.

2021-11-24 08:05:36

@cloudzombi @Akiz16 @firestarter_fi I think my tweet caused it, not me selling, although I am sure the selling didn't help

2021-11-24 08:10:33

GN Degens 😘  It appears though my tweets can actually cause price dumps on smaller caps. I guess it was inevitable, I just never thought about it. It's scary.  Still getting to grips with this whole having a following thing and learning along the way.

2021-11-24 08:20:13

@UJD07326336 I guess it depends on what your total portfolio is outside of crypto. I have larger portfolios outside of crypto.

2021-11-24 08:25:45

@cloudzombi @babboycheif What's the opensea link for the hiros I still do t see it in their discord

2021-11-24 15:30:33

@ChrisKryptik I have met many content people who make jokes. I met many people who aren't content that take everything seriously

2021-11-24 15:32:24

@toneyourlife When presale holder tokens are unlocked. If they are up by a big amount they may dump their tokens. Increases circulating supply.

2021-11-24 15:52:17

@chirmainman @lukso_io I like it but I am trying to think of something shorter and that isn't tied to a single crypto 🤣

2021-11-24 15:57:33

@HSydneyHC @futrii Wow want an absolute unit of a woman taking on a bear

2021-11-24 16:04:46

@danipop99james Life would be more fun if you stop taking jokes this seriously.

2021-11-24 16:46:30

GM Degens 😘  I am lucky to be in crypto and lucky to have found CT. So many great friends made. This has been a mind blowing experience.  Will try and deliver some alpha today.

2021-11-24 16:48:20

@CryptoAllyy Awesome I am glad you are making money!

2021-11-24 16:52:56

I want everyone here to make money. Even the rude knobheads.

2021-11-24 16:53:25

@CryptoPaus @cantata_nft @PancakeBunnyFin Too many NFTs to mint

2021-11-24 16:57:11

@sol_flipper I will DCA when it makes sense

2021-11-24 17:01:16

@mrjansenr I don't, it is a joke

2021-11-24 17:13:30

@kajlool never even heard of it

2021-11-24 17:32:08

How many bags do you have?  Not handbags, #crypto bags. I have over 30.

2021-11-24 17:50:36

2/ Launchpads mint millionaires. If you know any good-looking new launchpads, share them, so others can research and buy.  SFUND is too expensive for most people at this point, but let's find the next SFUND!

2021-11-24 17:50:36

1/ Talk about life-changing gains. $SFUND has just blasted off again. I bought it at 0.9 and it hit 14.85 today.  #Launchpads really are where it's at. Not only has SFUND floating at a 14x gain. It also got me into $BLOK, $FINA, $CWAR, $TRY presales and many more.

2021-11-24 17:54:16

@ChrisRomanoC Its fascinating how people differ. I find it so easy to manage my bags the way I have everything set up. I was just having this conversation with a friend.  If I limited myself to 5 bags I would have skipped many great projects like SFUND, UFO, and others

2021-11-24 17:56:19

@CryptoShotta 💯 Why sell when you keep getting killer launches!

2021-11-24 18:20:05

@TheN00b8 Not in terms of launchpads

2021-11-24 18:34:24

Andy should be at 20k already, send him frens!

2021-11-24 18:38:33

@ricky_corda @TrustSwap I have but what makes it the best?

2021-11-24 18:43:46

@jasonpizzino @KrownCryptoCave I like Crypto Simps. Talk about me and how awesome I am at the start of every ep. Really sell that simp angle!

2021-11-24 18:49:40

@jasonpizzino I am so bad with names. I want to change my name to something shorter but I have spent two weeks thinking and I have nothing

2021-11-24 18:50:33

@tronster0015 Split over three

2021-11-24 18:56:40

@MikeyFergus_ This is what I do

2021-11-24 19:08:09

@ruelrahim24 Jealous about what?

2021-11-24 19:15:59

@CryptoMobsterYT Rookie numbers kid, you gotta pump those numbers. 38% of my portfolio is stable.

2021-11-24 19:19:58

Trying to think of a new name. Lady of Crypto is too long, I want something short n snappy. Any suggestions are welcome.  I was just going to go with "Goddess" for obvious reasons but that's too broad.

2021-11-24 19:21:14

@jasonpizzino I actually always wanted to move to Australia. The lifestyle you guys have appeals to me. So does the weather!

2021-11-24 19:22:10

@CrypttoReBeL I love this one but I dont want to be just a meta person!

2021-11-24 19:23:17

@Aeneas247 @jasonpizzino Yes this recent stuff is scary, I meant before all of it went down. Maybe NZ?

2021-11-24 19:25:45

@realumisan @Ghost_of_Haole My thoughts exactly.

2021-11-24 19:28:30

@Quamfy_Trader @CryptoMobsterYT Fiat would be kept in other financial markets, like stocks, commodities etc and is not counted!

2021-11-24 19:47:48

2/ Back then ILVs market cap was 350 mill to Axies 8 bill. Now ILV is approaching 1 bill and Axie is still floating around 8.  ILV has incredible room for growth. I believe it can be bigger than Axie next year.  The worst thing about ILV are its tokenomics.

2021-11-24 19:47:48

1/ If I had to pick games I think will flip Axie, $ILV would be one of them.   I first shared ILV on October 2nd when it was $550. Every time I shared it since people said "it's too late" or "it's too expensive".  I never understood that. #PlayToEarn is just getting started.

2021-11-24 19:47:49

3/ I plan to do a long thread of ILV in which I will cover the tokenomics along with other aspects.

2021-11-24 19:53:18

@MarkAkramzz People said it was late at 550 and today its 1.7k. People will say It's late today, and in a few months it will be 6k.

2021-11-24 19:53:38

@thecryptoboss_ Bought it presale.

2021-11-24 19:55:29

@vkywick Yes

@ExP_810 @CryptoMobsterYT I am happy to take beer as donations!

2021-11-24 20:04:54

@MikeyFergus_ I think a lot of people understand this but are still put off by the price!

2021-11-24 20:06:10

@rarefreak @ChrisRomanoC No, I wouldn't have allocated at all as they were runner-up projects.

2021-11-24 20:08:21

@nickyb1982 @ChrisRomanoC One thing that helps me a lot is my friends. They are not too active on CT but they are good traders. They each have their own sector, I am obviously the gaming one. So I focus mostly on gaming, one guy on passive, one on bluechips, etc.

2021-11-24 20:17:49

@ChrisRomanoC It can do but  I do have friends and we share the load. I am in a few DAOs and I know next to nothing about them. I trust my friend to do his research and keep up to date on them.  I should have explained myself properly when I said its easy. Easy with mates, not solo!

2021-11-24 20:20:45

@nebraskangooner LFG, crypto gaming is just breaking out all over the place!

2021-11-24 20:21:32

My mate just said he is doing a DCA into $ADA. What a cuck.

2021-11-24 20:24:00

@LunrCryptoLou You going in too Lou? Please say it isn't so. I cant be the only one of the crew not buying

2021-11-24 21:50:48

@09111007V I just like making fun of it because it does nothing and is boring. Doesn't mean it's not a blue chip worth holding. It will do something one day

2021-11-24 21:53:43

@09111007V You should probably read the news though, there a some regulatory concerns, I think that's why it's dumping!

2021-11-24 21:55:48

$UOS CEO, can you please lower price so I can load up on some dips? Breaking ATHs every day is getting old, stop showing off 😤  @ultra_io

@blockchainedbb All of my biggest bags don't care, love gaming

2021-11-24 22:33:23

@JJcycles Yes, it does.

2021-11-24 22:39:03

@crypto_iso The more bug influencers become convinced that gaming decouples from BTC. The faster it will decouple.

2021-11-24 22:40:47

@crypto_iso I would argue that we have seen sectors do this before and then come back into the fold. I want to see a permanent decoupling. While I really hope we are there, I am not convinced.

2021-11-24 22:44:11

@crypto_iso I have, I keep track of it daily. I am so deep in gaming cryptos that I hope this is the new normal. I am not disagreeing that we are currently decoupled. I am just not convinced it's permanent. I am trading as if it is permanent, though.

2021-11-24 22:45:37

@crypto_iso *big

2021-11-24 23:02:01

@CryptoMobsterYT @crypto_iso I only listen to myself. I am saying that people like him, regardless of his past, can manifest reality with their influence. The more people like him convince followers gaming is its own thing, the sooner it happens. It is inevitable, maybe it's already happened.

2021-11-24 23:11:26

@CryptoMobsterYT @crypto_iso It could happen, anything could happen really. I ma not convinced MV doesn't crash if BTC nukes. Let's just see where it goes

2021-11-24 23:12:09

@May1968Paris Thank you 🙏

2021-11-24 23:17:45

@crypto_iso @broccolierabe @CryptoMobsterYT Same. I like what Becker is doing for gaming cryptos, but he is not my friend, he is not looking out for me.  I have my own investment plan, I execute it, and if it all goes to crap I can only blame me.

2021-11-25 02:09:26

@blockchainedbb I love you too 😘

2021-11-25 02:14:42

GN Degens 😘  $BLOK waking up and rallying. $PYR rallying. $GALA up 50% today alone. $HERO reversal starting. $MANA new ath $NTVRK new ath $RFOX 6 month high $ILV new ath $MC new ath  What do these all have in common? Just a few of the tokens I shilled weeks ago.

2021-11-25 07:01:20

Am I bragging? Yes. Had some champagne. I want to brag. GN

@georgepina10 I plan to hold for years, it's an investment. I take profit as it runs up, but I am not getting all out.

2021-11-25 13:43:17

@JasonTa35976126 I have money in them too. They just didn't make a new high yet today.

2021-11-25 13:55:56

@jkaicrypto Don't blame me if you UOS dumps, I always say wait for dips

2021-11-25 14:06:15

@jkaicrypto Nice!

2021-11-25 14:06:43

@ThrashSydney It's a multi year hold for me

2021-11-25 14:07:53

@jasonpizzino Didn't they announce a partnership recently? I guess partnering with ADA is a death blow for anyone.

2021-11-25 14:09:42

@Ehsan29277396 The early lady gets the monies

2021-11-25 14:14:01

BREAKING NEWS: $ADA suing Elon Musk over "The Boring Company" name. #Cardano claims that it is the original boring company.

@Hugo_in_Yugo Just here to make jokes, not clout chase

2021-11-25 14:26:38

@sweetsinner3 So many questions.  Is this a role play thing, so if I have a man NFT can I be a man? What if I have a dog NFT, are dogs invited? What is the threshold for "rich"? Will I be sent NFT dick pics, because "no thanks"?

2021-11-25 14:28:58

@sweetsinner3 Was just in there for a few seconds. I feel my day has been ruined.

2021-11-25 14:31:58

@sweetsinner3 It's all about how you frame it. You have reframed, now I feel good!

@honey_btc GM honey, why do we do this to ourselves?

2021-11-25 17:29:24

$LYXE turning around. I was hoping to buy more at 12-13 but looks like 17 was my last chance to load up.   I took full advantage of the chance at 17 and now have a huge bag.  Did you join in? (after doing your own research)

2021-11-25 17:34:57

If you want to make it in this game, you need to be ready to cut and run without emotion. No bag is worth getting rekt over.  p.s. Watched Heat last night.  https://t.co/7b2M32W4KU

2021-11-25 17:35:28

@mellicrypto Happy to be here!

2021-11-25 18:07:22

I've been building a bag of $ROSE the last week and a half. I am going to do a thread on it.  I am not up a lot since I have been averaging in. Only around 30%.  Look into it, do your own research, or wait for my thread.  I am excited about it.  @OasisProtocol

2021-11-25 18:09:29

@GrennanKieran @rememberrooster You two guys getting this worked up over a silly joke. Either laugh at it or ignore it because you don't find it funny.

2021-11-25 18:10:30

Why does a 25 year old woman have to remind grown men how to be adults on CT?

2021-11-25 18:11:09

@DemirtopEray @OasisProtocol Yeah you asked me about it a few times and I ignored you. Sorry. I just didn't want to talk about it yet.

2021-11-25 18:14:04

@TysonThe2nd This is true, it was a trick question, you got it Tyson.

2021-11-25 18:14:56

@dsilva_gary @DemirtopEray @OasisProtocol I had a brief look and it did not catch my attention. I will take another look.

2021-11-25 18:16:50

@Mr_E_Graves You're alright so far though. Some dudes on here...

2021-11-25 18:19:02

@jasonpizzino 🤣 cant wait to hear two men trying to figure this one out.

2021-11-25 18:20:03

@Umranbasha1976 @OasisProtocol You asking how much money I got in?

2021-11-25 19:03:31

@Umranbasha1976 @OasisProtocol Any amount of coins, a bag is just a position, for some it's $10 for others it's $10 mill

2021-11-25 19:19:47

@adilism1 You can be as childish as you want, I am, I wasn't talking about that!

2021-11-25 19:24:09

@lee6ilbert I've shilled it for weeks and post about it almost daily. Apparently I am a top 10 influencer for it  https://t.co/usWT4YDJOr

2021-11-25 19:48:42

1/ Last week I wrote about #Metaverse and #PlayToEarn cryptos decoupling from $BTC.  Every day that goes by, that is looking more and more like reality. Will it last? I am hopeful, but not convinced.   https://t.co/KeR7zrqgei

2021-11-25 19:48:43

2/ This chart shows $MVI, which is the Metaverse index, an index of several MV cryptos overlaid on a $BTC chart.  Since the end of September MV has decoupled from BTC. This was due to Zuckerberg changing FBs name to Meta. News based decoupling is common and not noteworthy.  https://t.co/oDYogjieHg

2021-11-25 19:48:44

5/ What happens if BTC nukes from here? I find it hard to believe that gaming cryptos will not react. However, some of them have such strong uses cases that they might just survive.  Look at $PYR, there is already a huge user base, but it's going to get bigger.

2021-11-25 19:48:44

4/ I think much of this is FOMO driven, but I am starting to believe a lot of it is real. #PlayToEarn and #Metaverse legitimately seem to be breaking away.  We might have the first case of an entire sector decoupling from $BTC.

2021-11-25 19:48:44

3/ From the 10th of November, things have become strange. We are seeing a true decoupling. Last week I thought it was momentary and things would reset. One week later the gap is only getting bigger.  Is it permanent?

2021-11-25 19:48:45

8/ So is this a temporary decoupling like we have seen sectors do before? Or is this one the real deal?  I believe that only time will tell, but I am very excited I got in early and that I shared it with you lovely people.  Thoughts?

2021-11-25 19:48:45

7/ Then look at this, Grayscale sees metaverse as a sector with separate growth potential to BTC.   https://t.co/F00nfYqR1a

2021-11-25 19:48:45

6/ Their players are there for the game, not for the price of BTC.  Look at $UOS, a game distribution platform that will host crypto and non crypto games alike. It has its own blockchain, it is its own thing.   Why would UOS users care about the price of BTC?

2021-11-25 19:50:24

@TysonThe2nd $DOT gonna die

2021-11-25 20:00:23

@jasonpizzino Which one of the thousand?

2021-11-25 20:01:54

@starch78 Its on Kucoin, where all the good stuff is

2021-11-25 20:44:51

@mibospace yes

2021-11-25 20:49:19

@Lifeisgood1232 Yep, very different, is what it is!

2021-11-25 20:54:12

@Lifeisgood1232 It does, most people are awesome here!

2021-11-25 20:59:35

@Rebelshin Not really talking about if it will go up or down but if it will be independent of BTC.

2021-11-25 21:00:19

@SindromeBinario Agree with this, the tech needs to keep pace but I am not convinced it is.

2021-11-25 21:01:16

@MikeyFergus_ Yeah I think it will too but I am not thinking about whether it will go up or down, just that it might become independent.

2021-11-25 21:02:24

@ChrisRomanoC Yes and that is one of my biggest roadblocks at the moment. It takes time and most companies are even close to a working product.

2021-11-25 21:02:51

@BryanTamJJ Yeah they are the bluechips!

2021-11-25 21:08:12

@ChrisRomanoC *aren't

2021-11-25 21:15:01

@TheCryptoDaddi Agreed, I am sure everybody $LYXE my face better  https://t.co/JIWezPENbT

2021-11-25 21:15:21

@TheCryptoDaddi I'll see myself out

2021-11-25 21:16:19

@Mr_E_Graves That is where the guilds come in though. They set you up in game and take a cut of your earnings!

2021-11-25 21:16:38

@Mr_E_Graves Exactly!

2021-11-25 21:18:13

@ChrisRomanoC I have been following this one too. Glad to see you are on it!

2021-11-25 21:22:12

@Mr_E_Graves Many wont know about guilds or be bothered though. Some people just want to game!

2021-11-25 21:23:47

@WawasKingdom Talked about it before. I was in the presale. I shared it when it was 0.6, I am not updating as there isn't a whole lot to say

2021-11-25 21:48:40

@crypto_sannna @futrii @zachxbt This jealous tool accuses me of the same thing. I shut him down the other day with proof and he crawled back to his hole. Guess he has a new target. Sad life.

2021-11-25 22:27:23

@crypto_sannna @futrii @Crypto_holix @zachxbt 19th of Nov?  1.4k RT, whats this got anything to do with today?

2021-11-25 22:29:50

@crypto_sannna @futrii @Crypto_holix @zachxbt thats 1 screenshot

2021-11-25 22:34:31

@crypto_sannna @futrii @Crypto_holix @zachxbt You have a screenshot from the 19th that to me just seems like one of her many friends pumping her up a bit. What has that got to do with today?

2021-11-25 22:37:20

@crypto_sannna @futrii @Crypto_holix @zachxbt where are all of these imaginary screenshots? you said there are five? stop lying kid.

2021-11-25 22:40:09

@crypto_sannna @futrii @Crypto_holix @zachxbt You say there are five, I see one. The one is from the 19th, doesn't explain today.  All I see is a screenshot of a dude who probably knows her shilling her. I shill her all the time.

2021-11-25 22:44:22

@crypto_sannna @futrii @Crypto_holix @zachxbt What does the 19th have to do with the 25th. Could you please explain this simple fact?  You said you have 5 screenshots, where are they? Why are you lying about this? Why say you have 5 when you don't. You have a single unrelated screenshot.

2021-11-25 22:54:15

@babysfmnshiller @OasisProtocol This is a pretty dumb question. Am I meant to only share stuff I am not in?

2021-11-25 23:44:57

@DexGemsReal You didnt read everything if you are tweeting this :)   I say in 14/ its multi year

2021-11-26 00:33:06

@babysfmnshiller @OasisProtocol I disagree, I am looking at a real chart, it is consolidating

2021-11-26 00:46:15

@DexGemsReal Thank you!

2021-11-26 00:53:11

@BiddulphScott Why do people take jokes so seriously?

2021-11-26 01:24:52

I've been in crypto for 2 years as a boring BTC, ADA, LTC, etc HODLr. I decided to throw 4 figures into #gamefi this year and here we are.  The $1 mil doesn't even include my sidelined stable or NFTs. It's just my floating, which is 62%. I made it, I am in my 20s.

2021-11-26 01:24:52

This year I started with $6557, today I hit $1 mil 🥳🥳  I didn't do it with $BTC, $ETH, $SHIB, $ADA. I bought:  $ILV $34 $BLOK $0.00025 $SAND $0.06 $MANA $0.23 $AXS $1.22 $SOL $14.20  I am sharing my next 50x #PlayToEarn gem tonight. Never too late to make it in #crypto.

2021-11-26 01:27:14

Maybe this is bragging and will get me hate. I am just happy and I want to share it.  Dudes share their gaudy watches, cars, shoes, and whatever else.

2021-11-26 01:30:33

@BitKonger Seedify launchpad!

2021-11-26 01:32:22

@Nakamotolisk You up though right?

2021-11-26 01:33:25

@RoyalLL41630565 Thank you!

2021-11-26 01:34:28

2021-11-26 01:40:46

@CryptoMobsterYT hat sidelined stable we spoke about yesterday is not included 🤯 so my net worth is actually more. Loving life.

2021-11-26 01:41:03

2021-11-26 01:43:15

@LegacyofAshes No but I know a lot of gamers. It just made sense. Its a huge industry, everyone around me is a gamer. Kids play fortnite at school instead of talking to each other. Its a new world

2021-11-26 01:44:45

@sweetsinner3 You are amazing, thank you 😘

2021-11-26 03:14:58

I bought $NGL, an awesome new #PlayToEarn and #Metaverse token. I am doing a thread on it soon, but nobody can beat the thread master, @ChrisRomanoC .   Read his head to see why I am getting in, and give him a follow.  My thread coming soon and maybe a vid. #GameFi

2021-11-26 03:28:46

@Crypt0Simon @ChrisRomanoC I think this could be as 50x. Just sell the peaks and buy the dips like I always show.

2021-11-26 03:28:53

@Jackpot777888 @ChrisRomanoC I think this could be as 50x. Just sell the peaks and buy the dips like I always show.

2021-11-26 03:29:07

@andygriff5 @ChrisRomanoC Pancakeswap or Huobi

2021-11-26 03:29:30

@Sam_Comatose @ChrisRomanoC Not true, it's on pancakeswap, uniswap, and huobi

2021-11-26 03:30:29

@mcJoker_05 @ChrisRomanoC No. 50m market cap. Like saying PYR popped already at $3

2021-11-26 05:58:19

@LydiaScherr @LegacyofAshes Very scary

2021-11-26 05:58:34

@Adelyn_Janess @LegacyofAshes That part is sort of exciting

2021-11-26 05:59:36

@behardien17cfc @LegacyofAshes I played the levels like I always do

2021-11-26 06:06:14

$NGL is absolutely getting sent. We are up 22% from when I shilled it.  This one is a long term hold for me. It has everything needed to be one of the big boys in the #metaverse and #PlayToEarn genre.

2021-11-26 06:10:32

I had 22k when I woke up, I make that tweet below, and now I hit 40k.  What is going on?  This cant be real life. I have not even been here three months.  https://t.co/8u0TappWx4

2021-11-26 06:16:26

For the record. I gave you a heads-up 6 weeks ago about $NGL.   Not many people listened.  Now it's blowing up.  Who has the alpha?  For those asking where to buy. Huobi, Pancakeswap.

2021-11-26 06:25:38

@salman_ahmed786 yes

2021-11-26 06:27:22

@Jeff19724501 Well, not a 50x anymore since it went up but play the levels and yes it could hit a 2 bill market cap

2021-11-26 06:27:41

@JamesGrewal69 I just did

2021-11-26 06:32:24

The secret to holding bags for so long, like I did with $SAND, is that you don't set arbitrary targets and get out. You bleed profit out slowly as your bag rises.   https://t.co/d2VFdDyuSN  Then reinvest in the dips.   https://t.co/cRZidVwTky

@ericokey23 Sand. My Mana bag was small. Axienwas 300x but small bag. Sand wad a big bag and I played the levels really well on it so I grew the bag

@wallstreet47 Gave you NGL yesterday, do you people want a gem an hour? Jfc

2021-11-26 15:01:11

@pakkapolpreech1 I gave you a gem yesterday, it's up 50% $NGL

2021-11-26 15:02:05

@WalterW00773191 No, you shouldn't be a dumbass. Wait for dips.

2021-11-26 15:02:45

@CryptoWick8 @wallstreet47 I got in it a while ago, it's great

2021-11-26 15:04:40

@Bvcket0fAmpz Just into gaming.

2021-11-26 15:06:48

@chillwill2496 It is, I am a latecomer to RFOX but I see what's good and invest

@CharlieeSerious Or it's SAND ans it does 100x from there

2021-11-26 15:38:54

@Learner36 I posted it, look at my feed $NGL

2021-11-26 15:40:32

@Gregmendel1822 It's a toss up between the two, they are both amazing

2021-11-26 15:41:43

@sloth069 I picked plenty of crap ones that rugged or just never did anything. If something does a 50x you only need to be right 1 out of 50 times to make money

2021-11-26 15:44:32

@Crypto_Noobist @AltsOracle Ey I posted that joke two weeks ago 😂

2021-11-26 16:10:15

@warrbos_ETH_ Lol am I a copypasta now?

2021-11-26 16:31:25

@StackingUSD This is the worst, I get it all the time.

2021-11-26 16:40:56

$BTC ruining everyone's fun as usual

2021-11-26 16:43:34

@Karthik19039961 Eh? it did a massive pump to 40

2021-11-26 16:47:34

Just a reminder of my $BTC dip plan.  I keep money sidelined to buy the dips. I have a plan to buy BTC as low as 10k. The deep the dip the bigger I go.  This is why I take profit religiously. To be able to buy when it gets red.

2021-11-26 16:51:50

@xanthamgum Units dont matter, its just an example. If you have 500k or if you have 1k, the amounts are not the point.

2021-11-26 16:59:52

BLACK FRIDAY DEALS  $BTC prices slashed 20% $ETH prices slashed 20% $ADA prices slashed 30%

2021-11-26 17:01:50

@crypto_joey No ma'am, deeper discounts as the day goes on!

2021-11-26 17:06:27

@AltcoinGordon It will be worth $600k per XRP as soon as the lawsuit is over!

2021-11-26 17:07:36

@honey_btc @cryptocevo Real money is in a bear market.

2021-11-26 17:12:59

@Yupyuppers123 I fucked up a lot too.

2021-11-26 17:14:21

@cryptodiary0000 I think the next big sector will be adult entertainment

2021-11-26 17:20:27

@buffermet @xanthamgum It doesnt in this scenario. I am not telling people to use 50k, I am just using 50k as an example  It could be 500k split 100k pots  It could be 5m split into 1m pots  It could be 5k split into 1k pots  It could be 20k split into 1k pots if you want to do 20 coins

2021-11-26 17:22:19

@xanthamgum Okay I thought you meant the pot size.  The BTC bottom price. I only talk about BTC price in USD. Also, it does not really matter in this scenario. I am not saying 10k is the bottom, I am saying I have a plan to buy as low as 10k.  My entire point is that I don't know the bottom

2021-11-26 17:44:14

@crypto_birb Give 5 analyst's a chart and you gat 5 different opinions on where it's going

2021-11-26 17:48:44

@cryptocevo 💯 you give some of the most solid advice here. Stable on the side is a requirement.

2021-11-26 17:54:47

@xanthamgum @coinskid 🤣😂  You cant pick tops or bottoms. That why I scale in and out instead!

2021-11-26 18:01:09

I'm going to go out today.  This market is not for buying. I'll reassess alts if or when $BTC is 53k and then 50k to decide if I want to buy.  Most of my bags are way up because I am in #PlayToEarn and #Metaverse, and I've taken profits as below   https://t.co/d2VFdDyuSN

2021-11-26 18:04:08

I am going to hit 70k before $BTC  Who'da thunk it?  https://t.co/Pz7o5frgKg

2021-11-26 18:08:23

@kalaishere I am talking about my follower count lol

2021-11-26 18:09:24

For those confused 70k followers, not $70K

2021-11-26 18:10:10

@tradinglord Mostly in stable is what I like to hear. Nice work.

2021-11-26 18:10:58

@Thomasvned aim for 40% but I do get lower at times.

2021-11-26 18:11:22

@CryptoAllyy Yes

2021-11-26 18:13:12

@Crypto_Voltic You are a dumbass, the entire market dumped thanks to BTC, I am holding NGL still. Also I shilled it at 5 and its at 7. Pump and dump? I swear people on here are absurdly stupid sometimes.

2021-11-26 18:20:16

@Razvan_CR11 So many people ask this, all you need to do is look at my feed I posted $NGL

2021-11-26 22:56:23

@tcbean I am all about taking profit. I mention it daily on here.

2021-11-26 22:57:44

@stonedtrader1 Just into gaming. I picked a lot of shit games too that rugged or failed. A few 100x make up for the failures.

@crypto_iso I went viral from a tweet, life is weird lately

2021-11-27 01:05:10

@trader1sz @crypto_iso Not 2-3 days, 24 hours. I made this tweet last night and went from 22k to this   https://t.co/qSY6RLAy0A

2021-11-27 01:13:38

@crypto_iso I tweeted this.  Now I am getting asked for my next gem in every tweet lol. I do not think it's something you should envy.  It's why I have been off most of today. Trying to figure out if I should keep doing this.   https://t.co/qSY6RLAy0A

2021-11-27 01:14:44

@crypto_iso As far as I am concerned I do not deserve this and not sure I want the pressure.

2021-11-27 01:35:06

$PYR is the one.  I got in at 7.   @crypto_iso and SZ got in at 3.  @ChrisRomanoC brought it to Twitter.  These are the guys you should be following as well. They know #PlayToEarn and #Metaverse

2021-11-27 01:53:32

I shared $NGL before it was released six weeks ago.  I shared it again yesterday at $5.  Now it almost hit $9 on a day that $BTC is dumping.  #Metaverse and #PlayToEarn game with a 100 mill MC. It's just getting started.

2021-11-27 01:57:11

@NiffoBTC This is it. I said I was posting it and an hour later I posted $NGL. I am not sure why people are struggling to understand this?

2021-11-27 02:00:25

WTF I am top influencer for NGL?   What is going on with my life right now?

2021-11-27 17:07:07

I got into #gamefi cryptos early expecting the sector to blow up. I picked many good projects but rugs too.  Imo, the next sector to blow up is the adult entertainment industry. It is a perfect fit for crypto.   Also, I cant wait for all the puns on the timeline.

2021-11-27 17:08:23

2021-11-27 21:27:23

@SimonSvatos1 @zachxbt @CryptoGodJohn What an absolute knob. Calling out scammers while running a pump and dump group.  It's always the people who accuse others of being dodge who are the dodgiest.

@sweetsinner3 @1billiondollarz @ledererhouston @Adouble212 @futrii @MoonKing___ @AltcoinGordon @RAFAELA_RIGO_ @SalehAhmedd_ 🤣 this dude is so salty.  He called me a fraud out of nowhere. He got mad when I blocked him. I think it all stemmed from me unfollowing him because I didn't enjoy his content.  Fraud, please, two of my wallets are public since I shared NFTs I bought.

2021-11-27 22:10:08

@sweetsinner3 @1billiondollarz @ledererhouston @Adouble212 @futrii @MoonKing___ @AltcoinGordon @RAFAELA_RIGO_ @SalehAhmedd_ He is serious. He came at me and called me a fraud. Then had a hissy fit when I blocked him. Like calling somebody a fraud doesn't justify a block 🤷‍♀️

I am out tonight but I promised an $AVAX gem. I was meant to write a thread on this one but I got busy.  $CRAFT gaming gem.  I am in this today, I got a big bag. I think this one will be big. Will do a thread to tomorrow.

2021-11-28 04:36:08

@joecryp98721446 @trader1sz First SZ is a mate. Second, I don't think he called NGL, NAKA, FLAME, NETVRK, UOS, etc. If he did, amazing, because he knows his shit. If he didn't, then suck my dick dumbass

2021-11-28 05:52:53

@togra8888 XAVA  launchpad was how you got into this one. I was in XAVA but I messed up and missed IGO

2021-11-28 05:53:51

@SweatySatoshi @togra8888 Lol, what a dumb comment. This is public knowledge, XAVA launchpad.

2021-11-28 07:25:00

@tooshay_booshay 50x from what?

2021-11-28 07:42:36

1/ $CRAFT  - Low market cap ($252 m) - #Metaverse &amp; #PlayToEarn - On $AVAX - The game looks amazing - VC vesting is great  Not financial advice, do your own research.  @Talecraftio #NFT #NFTGame

2021-11-28 07:42:37

2/ -POTENTIAL- Metaverse is a booming sector. A $25m market cap would put this in the top 80 metaverse. In my opinion this is much higher than a top 80. Long-term I would expect a market cap of a few hundred million.  This is not financial advice, it's my personal expectation.  https://t.co/2maYi9Am34

2021-11-28 07:42:38

3/ -TOKENOMICS- The tokenomics for CRAFT are phenomenal. 1.7m circulating supply at the moment, the max supply is 30m but there is a burning mechanism which will eat away 5m of the supply.  CRAFT is required in order to play the game, which will keep demand for the token high.  https://t.co/Dckrhe5ni6

2021-11-28 07:42:39

4/ -NO PRESALE DUMPS- Presale investors receive 5% on TGE and won't receive more tokens for 90 days, therefore they won't be able to dump. After that, they are vested for 15 or 18 months vesting.  Good vesting is the mark of a good project.  https://t.co/Dyz5EruTvV

2021-11-28 07:42:40

6/ -MY PLAN- I will be scaling in and buying the dips. I never ape in a full bag unless I am in presale. As with anything, do not be a dumbass.

2021-11-28 07:42:40

5/ -BUYING- Buying was a pain. I had to bridge from ERC20 to AVAX C Chain using the official AVAX bridge (DYOR) and then buy on Trader Joe.  You can also buy AVAX on KuCoin and withdraw to C Chain.

2021-11-28 07:45:39

@Ajibola05554834 50x from presale, people are on a 3-month cliff like I said

2021-11-28 07:50:31

@nebraskangooner I dont want to make money because I pay 20% tax on it.

2021-11-28 07:52:55

2021-11-28 17:25:09

@honey_btc GM gorgeous, what a view.

2021-11-28 18:02:13

1/ This is how I bought $SAND at 0.06 and held it till today.  I talk about scaling in and out all the time, but visualising how to do it over several months, and retraces, is hard.   Now you have a rough guide. These numbers are not precise but close enough. NFA DYOR  https://t.co/ULGI7S8yiI

2021-11-28 18:02:14

2/ So when people ask "what's your target"  I do not have one. I invest for the long term scale-out profit at resistance and scale in at support on dips.  For $SAND I was using psychological levels as support and resistance.   https://t.co/aAe6RE1h2A

2021-11-28 18:02:15

3/ Here are guides on buying dips and taking profit  https://t.co/d2VFdDyuSN  https://t.co/cRZidVwTky

2021-11-28 18:04:36

4/ If I believe a project will continue to grow, targets do not make sense. It's like setting a target on $BTC when if I bought in 2011.  I am not shy about taking profits and reinvesting, but setting an arbitrary target is not my style.

2021-11-28 18:05:24

@salman_ahmed786 The entire point I am making here is that I don't have targets, I scale in and out.

2021-11-28 18:10:49

5/ I scale out my initial investment at 20% at a time as it goes up. So with an entry at 0.06  0.12 - 20% out 0.18 - 20% out 0.24 - 20% out 0.30 - 20% out 0.36 - 20% out  Depending on the crypto and the outlook, I may scale-out faster than this. This was a slow scale-out.

2021-11-28 18:19:39

@srg_green Yes that and also psych levels

2021-11-28 18:20:24

@seanwilks87 My friend has 20 years of trading experience, he taught me.

2021-11-28 18:23:50

@fatiralvi What?

2021-11-28 18:26:00

@seanwilks87 I hold it still

2021-11-28 18:27:07

6/ Adding this to say I still hold $SAND and I am still buying and selling the dips. My first tweet sort of made it sound like I sold SAND today. I did not, I am a long term holder.

2021-11-28 18:38:00

@robbievblfc @cryptosavage8 I gave the warning so people had a few hours to get set up to use Trader Joe. I don't normally do it that way, but I wanted everyone to have a fair chance.  It pumped 30% from the time I gave the warning to the time I shilled. My expectation here is a 10x so 30% doesn't matter

2021-11-28 18:39:43

@ct_chain Great. Good thing I have been taking profit. I will buy the dip at 4 and 3 and 2 if it gets to it.

2021-11-28 18:40:16

@geoshubham @altura_nft Bought it ages ago

2021-11-28 18:51:51

@cryptocevo 💯 not missing anything, child-like fights from grown men 🤣

2021-11-28 19:00:40

@kryptotrader2 @joecryp98721446 @trader1sz Maybe a lot of influencers are talking about it because its a good project. A lot of drama and accusations in this place. I don't do paid shills.

2021-11-28 19:01:25

@behardien17cfc No I DCA at key levels

@RAFAELA_RIGO_ What happened?  You will come back girl, you are a fighter and a badass.

2021-11-28 19:56:34

@RAFAELA_RIGO_ 😘

2021-11-28 20:03:45

@stbEXbanker 30 normally but I could have up to 60. It's quite easy if you have a proper sheet that is built for the job.  I am not tracking every crypto as much as something like SAND. Shitcoins and bluechips get nowhere near as much scaling in and out.

2021-11-28 20:04:45

@stbEXbanker Also, this is a daily chart, at most I need to record a few trades per day. I think a 200x return is worth this effort personally.

2021-11-28 20:20:31

@bozinggg I think you are misunderstanding. I sold and bought back far cheaper. If I just HODLd my performance would have been far worse.

2021-11-28 20:29:38

@jimtalbot @trader1sz If having a twitter excludes you from presales though, that is a bad deal. Presales are absurdly profitable.

2021-11-28 20:51:14

@trader1sz ADA LFG

2021-11-28 20:59:32

If you dont use $MVI to keep track of how #metaverse is performing as a whole, you should. MVI is an index that combines some of the top MV and #PlayToEarn tokens like $ILV, $MANA, $AXS, $SAND, $YGG and more.  It gives you an idea of how gaming cryptos are performing.  https://t.co/xrSsYbcAYw

2021-11-28 20:59:33

Another fun thing is to overlay a BTCUSDT chart on MVI to see how Metaverse has decoupled. At least its fun for me because I am a chart geek.  https://t.co/qdzER7HUvE

2021-11-28 21:28:03

I shared this 2 days ago and my following exploded.  My story is true, but I didn't only pick winners. I picked cryptos that dumped. I got rugged. I bought tops. I sold bottoms.   I put 5 figures on $BUNNY at $500. That was a -99.5% lesson.  I am not perfect. I am often wrong.

2021-11-28 21:28:04

I keep going though.   When I pick a good crypto I take profit religiously and reinvest the dips, or into other projects.  I research my ass off to find projects early. When I do get in late I scale in dips instead of ape.  I have a small team and we share research.

2021-11-28 21:28:05

Success isn't always being right. It's about accepting when you're wrong and learning from it. It's also about working as hard as you can to achieve your goals.

2021-11-28 21:31:28

Oh and if you get in projects early. Accept that 5 out of 10 will do nothing. 2 will do almost nothing, 2 will make you some money, and if you're lucky, 1 will make you a fortune. If you have the sense to play it right.

2021-11-28 21:36:58

@CryptoXaniera No problem ☺️

2021-11-28 21:53:45

I hope you loaded up on $HERO when I did because this project is 🔥🔥🔥 and that entry was timed to absolute perfection.  Up 63% but @Metahero_io is only just warming up.  This is why patience is key. I could have aped the top but I waited for a retrace.   #metaverse #gamefi  https://t.co/KoiJBz2DVv

2021-11-28 21:55:28

@Adouble212 If people talked to me in the real world like they talk to me on here, there would be a lot of slaps flying around. Not all people, most of you are nice enough.

2021-11-28 21:57:56

@sweetsinner3 OMG BUT YOU SOLD SOME TRAITOR!

2021-11-28 22:10:32

Did a cheeky little DCA into $HTR here at 1.36 since it is a good price.   It could fall further so I am leaving the option to buy more at 0.98 and 0.75  Not financial advice, do your own research, don't be a dumbass.  @HathorNetwork  https://t.co/5fYbgiBmiM

2021-11-28 22:15:08

@fut024 @HathorNetwork Yes

@DesepKing @HathorNetwork Yes I did

2021-11-29 00:38:54

@crypto_birb @trader1sz @Trader_XO Unfollowed them and then refollowed!

2021-11-29 00:53:47

@BrcUwu @CanteringClark Eh? Most of what I buy is on Kucoin or Binance. I try to never touch BSC unless I need to. Pleb.

2021-11-29 00:54:47

@CanteringClark I thought I was doing good with 20k. Then I made that tweet and I blew up. Life is weird sometimes.

2021-11-29 00:57:01

@CanteringClark So much salt in the comments. Why cant anyone ever be happy for anyone?

2021-11-29 01:03:44

@CanteringClark Yes, I am exaggerating a bit. Most people have been lovely. Just very weird for me to see hate thrown my way when I feel like I didn't do anything to deserve it.   It is a crazy number, I was at 22k that morning, by the next day I was 3x.  Surely not a record though?

2021-11-29 01:04:44

@sol_theprofit @CanteringClark What are you talking about? I always say when I get in. When I say "hope you all got in" its because I am quote tweeting and the previous tweet was the one saying I got in.

2021-11-29 01:08:40

@sol_theprofit @CanteringClark If you look at the chain of tweets, I tweeted every step along the way, now its up 60%   https://t.co/H0Tbw0H5YQ  Or HTR today up 20% from where I tweeted   https://t.co/2ysdP0o8lN  Do you people just make stuff up for fun or are you to dumb to look at the quoted tweet?

2021-11-29 01:09:04

@CanteringClark Thank you fren!

2021-11-29 01:09:22

@thejosh21 @CanteringClark I know right!

2021-11-29 01:12:07

@cloudzombi @CanteringClark Thank you Sloth. You have always been awesome!

2021-11-29 01:12:35

@thejosh21 @CanteringClark I am a little late on delivering that one. Next week!

2021-11-29 01:12:58

@thejosh21 @CanteringClark Also, I would never forget an OG like you John!

2021-11-29 01:13:28

@shnu1251 @Metahero_io Nice work. I came to this project way too late.

2021-11-29 01:15:07

Already started moving from the entry in the tweet below. Hope you were about to get in.   $HTR is going places. Will try do a thread on this one soon.  I will keep buying dips!

2021-11-29 01:22:23

@psyidon @bozinggg A spreadsheet helps with the calculations.

2021-11-29 01:27:50

@Vince_Zurich It's possible but in this case I tweeted 3 hours ago and HTR only moved 30 min ago in a big way.

2021-11-29 01:28:38

@Mile_fi It will rug by 2024 so 0, but already for over a year

2021-11-29 01:29:33

@Zachary_Fbaby Kucoin is a major exchange and the best exchange. Most coins I buy are on there.

2021-11-29 04:04:00

@thejosh21 @CanteringClark Exactly Jim!

2021-11-29 04:21:52

If you ever feel down and like you're NGMI, just remember, some 12 year old kid out there probably bought $SHIB with his Roblox money, and he's now a millionaire.

2021-11-29 04:24:21

@debanks_ddp Not even remotely

2021-11-29 04:26:56

@sin_gambito This is the joke

2021-11-29 04:29:00

@TexasSoccerFan I shorted the top and shared my entry here.

@ishalbecks07 @jeremyvarlow I dont have a telegram group 🤣

2021-11-29 04:39:13

@CaleCrypto Why would children be taught important life skills like budgeting, calculating tax, basic investing? That doesn't make for a good little mindless consumer.

2021-11-29 04:56:08

@CryptoAM17 Nice one, I missed this dip opportunity!

2021-11-29 05:33:59

$NGL dipped today like other #Metaverse tokens. It looks to be recovering now.  We're up 60% from the 5 entry I tweeted. Unfortunately, I didn't add more on this dip.   The barrier atm is 10.00, if it breaks, I see a rally. Not financial advice, do your own research.  https://t.co/pBMe4Lfotl

2021-11-29 05:34:00

In my opinion, NGL has PYR like the potential of hitting a 750 mill MC or more. The current MC for NGL is 100 mill, it has a lot of room to grow.

2021-11-29 05:36:53

@Adouble212 Don't give targets, it's all guesswork anyway.

2021-11-29 05:37:57

@CryptokoningME Sold NAKA and dont have interest in rebuying. Vesting and token release is shocking.

2021-11-29 05:39:49

@CryptokoningME Massive amount of tokens held by private investors who will dump on everyone when price is high enough.

@Gallopaway7 I would be nowhere near as up.  I wouldn't have had money to invest in other projects had I not been cashing out.  If I HODLd and it crashed I would have walked away with nothing.

@VulcanForged Damn I was writing a thread on AAG too. This is great.

@Christi65708411 @Adouble212 Exactly

2021-11-29 07:12:30

Trading is not about being right, it's about being profitable.

2021-11-29 07:18:26

@ChristopSurfer No it doesn't. You could pick 1 good and 99 rugs, as long as the good one does 101x you are profitable. Only right 1% but profitable

I make fun of $ADA a lot but if $BTC doesn't nuke again, I see ADA back near 2.50 soon, I think it can move from this level.  Not financial advice, do your own research.

2021-11-29 16:48:38

@martinoosthuizn I have a plan and I execute it. If I put in 20k and I am at 45k then taking out 4k gives me money to reinvest on the next dip or to buy something else.  Too many people here blindly HODL without ever taking profit. They get rekt.

@Nakamotolisk @CanteringClark Awww you called me cute.  Thank you fren 🥰  Also my alpha on point, agreed!

2021-11-29 19:29:50

@Nakamotolisk @CanteringClark @FuegoDAO That was a bad move, I knew the guy was dodgy but I have too much faith in people :(

2021-11-29 19:30:32

@Nakamotolisk @CanteringClark So that is a 10/10 compared to a southern lass!

2021-11-29 19:32:50

@crypto_birb 🤣 picture to remind himself of what he should never become!

2021-11-29 20:04:20

@AnzehCrypto @cryptoshaman11 Overbought doesn't mean anything in crypto, especially not with memecoins. How long was SHIB overbought for?

2021-11-29 20:10:29

@Rendisie Yes

2021-11-29 20:12:41

@cryptoshaman11 @AnzehCrypto Nonits not on PCS, that is a fake

2021-11-29 20:25:21

@JakobiCrypto @Ankit16833892 @AnzehCrypto Smart, dont let anybody talk you into an investment you don't agree with.

2021-11-29 20:30:18

@AdvocateAda A joke is not FUD.  Fear Uncertainty Doubt  Where is "humor" in that?  From when I had no followers I said I own Cardano but I made jokes about it because I like making jokes. I also joke about ETH, is that FUD.

2021-11-29 20:32:16

@AdvocateAda Your entire identity is tied to a single asset, that means you are not a serious investor. Anybody makes fun of the asset you have married yourself to, you get defensive. Weird.

2021-11-29 20:44:48

My top three #Metaverse projects  $PYR $RFOX $UFO  Was 200% up on RFOX, as with any crypto, I take partial profit when up. Looking to reinvest in this dip. 0.235 looks like the ideal spot!

2021-11-29 20:48:19

@VRA_FAN_BOY What is an RFOX?

2021-11-29 20:51:52

@Nakamotolisk I am unusually smart for a human.

2021-11-29 21:56:49

@c33xbt There is significant support at 0.22. Support is somewhat subjective but I am confident in that one. My support has a pretty good track record if you look at all my calls.  I don't mind if it doesn't come, I am just saying if it does, I buy. I buy before support, hence .235  https://t.co/vNciYP90ks

2021-11-29 22:01:27

Apparently, @LunarCRUSH says I am the 30th most influential in the world. After less than 3 months here 🤣🤣  What is going on with my life?  And right behind my arch-nemesis @AltcoinGordon the shady bastard. I am coming for you!  https://t.co/hHf4YFXvsT

@sweetsinner3 @TysonThe2nd Thank you girl 🥰

2021-11-29 22:04:28

@TysonThe2nd @sweetsinner3 I dont know what a fed means in this context so I am probably not one!

@sweetsinner3 @LunarCRUSH @AltcoinGordon He is going down.

2021-11-29 22:05:32

@AltcoinGordon @LunarCRUSH You have been warned!

2021-11-29 22:09:19

@cryptoaladeen @TysonThe2nd Eventually, they all simp, even you

2021-11-29 22:13:40

@AltcoinGordon @LunarCRUSH Thanks Gordon!

2021-11-29 22:14:16

@SindromeBinario @LunarCRUSH @AltcoinGordon I think it stays at this point

2021-11-29 22:20:10

@tumichaelonline @LunarCRUSH @AltcoinGordon Maybe. I already post to my friends discord and to @blockchainedbb so one more would not be extra work

2021-11-29 22:24:02

@MacroCRG I got a genuine question. Is this the coin that Inversebull and his crew are all in? The creator is a dude with a tophat or a fedora or something?

2021-11-29 22:26:05

@Nakamotolisk @MacroCRG @HEXcrypto I like those odds

2021-11-29 22:27:16

@bony__1997 @LunarCRUSH @AltcoinGordon Been here 2.5 months kid, not been corrupted yet.

2021-11-29 22:28:23

@Nakamotolisk @MacroCRG @HEXcrypto Ooo you got in temple. Very nice move, I am in too.

2021-11-29 22:38:13

@MacroCRG Me neither. I think the dude who made HEX is now working on Pulse Chain. It's meant to be the next Hex but better. I have it on my research list but haven't started my research.  I don't know much about either project but I will buy a little pulse regardless in case it does a hex

2021-11-29 22:41:20

@meerkat_crypto @drfahad200 Fair, I hadn't moved it off exchange yet anyway

2021-11-29 22:43:04

@Nina89751611 I shared them a while ago. I will share more stuff as I invest in it!

2021-11-29 22:59:45

@Knowcoinery I love the salt

2021-11-29 23:06:45

@spinholz @Razvan_CR11 50x from when I mentioned this. I believe the market cap was 50 mill at the time. 2.5 bill in the next year or two is easy for a good game.

2021-11-29 23:17:34

@kryptonicko I own some

2021-11-29 23:22:55

2/-POTENTIAL- I look at market caps of similar games to gauge where a project can go.  $NGL 96m  $PYR 750m (8x) $ALICE 600m (6) $ILV 1b (10x) $AXS 8b (80x)  Compared to its peers, NGL has massive room for growth. It is still very early.

2021-11-29 23:22:55

1/ $NGL is a 🔥 #metaverse n #playtoearn game with 10x or more potential.  Gold Fever wasn't thrown together to capitalise on the MV boom. Work started in 2020, first with the economic model, then the game was built around it.  Which makes me very bullish on the project 🚀🚀🚀

2021-11-29 23:22:57

3/ -TOKENOMICS- Circulating supply is 12.4m making current MC 96m. Total supply is 170m but there are burning mechanisms and locking that will keep the circulating supply much lower.  44% locked for mining. Team and advisors have 20%, which is standard.  https://t.co/LWGoTjeKaW

2021-11-29 23:22:58

4/ -TOKENOMICS Cont- Token release will be gradual, by month three tokens will be less than double, by month 5 less than triple.  I like seeing a slow and steady release of tokens. That is what we have here.  Tokenomics are an 8/10 imo  https://t.co/4XC1t8AWqO

2021-11-29 23:22:59

5/ -VESTING- Good vesting is the mark of a good project for me and as you see the vesting for $NGL is great. A 3-month cliff means presale investors won't get tokens for 3 months. When they do, it's less than 4% per month. This will keep price stable and reduce presale dumps.  https://t.co/5pL2wstp2N

2021-11-29 23:23:00

8/ -VISION CONT- NGL wants to build a game that people love playing, which from the look of it, they have.  https://t.co/PrNgznuzEQ

2021-11-29 23:23:00

7/ -VISION- Many #p2e games being released at the moment were slapped together in two months, trying to catch the #gamefi hype.  Gold Fever has been in production for years. They are gamers first, and #crypto second. This means that the game is actually enjoyable.

2021-11-29 23:23:00

6/ -TEAM- CEO of the project Emilian is accessible to the community, which I love. He is on the Discord answering questions, and just taking part.  The team is huge, with over 50 employees globally.

2021-11-29 23:23:01

9/ -GAMEPLAY- The whitepaper does a great job of explaining the gameplay. The basics are that the game is divided into mining claims. Each claim holds gold and there are PvP battles for the gold. More in the WP   https://t.co/gfLcFtZjMM  https://t.co/QqKo68MpMX

2021-11-29 23:23:02

10/ -COMING UP- BETA is out in a few days, which is huge news.  https://t.co/YHsZwUobLv

2021-11-29 23:23:03

13/ -SOURCES- @ChrisRomanoC made my life easy with his detailed thread and research. Credit where credit is due.  https://t.co/2Td0XjKGEg

2021-11-29 23:23:03

12/ -LINKS &amp; INFO- Website:  https://t.co/s6NXwXQ5Yo CMC:  https://t.co/Qpzg6Gawjs CG:  https://t.co/jlOtCgEut6  Available on GATE, HUOBI, Pancakeswap, and UNISWAP.  Please DYOR on contract

2021-11-29 23:23:03

11/ -MY OPINION &amp; PLAN- In my opinion, it is only getting warmed up. I will keep accumulating on dips and doing my thing.  I want to be a major holder for $NGL, as well as a holder of land claims in the game.

2021-11-29 23:48:27

@mjasinek @hetshod @ChrisRomanoC If you don't read or do your research, you should never invest in anything. A cursory glance at FD market cap hardly ever tells the full story.

2021-11-29 23:49:32

@AltcoinGordon @btc_charlie 🤣😂

I don't like to brag, but I'll brag about my $ROSE call here. I said I was loading up near the 0.27 support, dropped just below my support and BOOM 🚀  LFG, I hope you did your own research, didn't take it as financial advice, and got in, we up 30%  @OasisProtocol  #Metaverse  https://t.co/5xLT5BPo8j

2021-11-30 06:05:26

@ichbinbullish @OasisProtocol Good

2021-11-30 06:06:13

@Jennie30224066 @OasisProtocol No, this is a long term hold!

2021-11-30 06:06:49

@kylerslife @OasisProtocol Long term hold, I take profit as a trade runs. I don't take everything out at a arbitrary target

2021-11-30 06:08:08

@kryptonicko @Nina89751611 Of course not, I always fill and then shill!

If you don't take profit, you won't make profit.

2021-11-30 07:17:14

@Sunnyk314 No. Most big gains are taking small profit at resistance and reinvesting it on dips. Taking 10% at resistance isn't going to ruin your trade.

2021-11-30 07:23:43

2021-11-30 08:39:50

@Cryptonymintana @ishalbecks07 @Sunnyk314 This shows that inexperienced traders shouldn't be trading. I learned from an experienced trader and I am trying to pass on that knowledge

2021-11-30 08:48:15

@sweetsinner3 👍 it's a long term hold for sure!

2021-11-30 08:52:43

@astrojoe001 I do think long term. I sell resistance, buy the dip, and build up my holdings. That way by the time it's 100x I have 2000 coins instead of 1000.

2021-11-30 17:40:51

Probably nothing

2021-11-30 17:41:13

@AltcoinGordon I love that I have become a copypasta

2021-11-30 17:46:27

@cryp1121 @inversebrah Every like must follow, every follow must like  https://t.co/HmLu4us9f6

2021-11-30 17:49:57

@CryptoMichNL @CryptopepperP Fair enough, I might as well try!

2021-11-30 17:53:58

@growsolnft @inversebrah The guy was having an argument that kept showing up on my notifications so I gave a vague answer to appease both of them. I don't have plans for a paid group 🤣

2021-11-30 17:55:40

@growsolnft @inversebrah Look at my timeline, almost everything I posted is up 50%-500%. The proof is in calling trades before they happen. Which I've done consistently since starting.

2021-11-30 17:57:48

@tradinglord Grand rising!  That is sad though.

2021-11-30 18:06:33

@growsolnft @inversebrah Just went on Binance to get a screenie of my spot. I could only look back 6 months in spot history 🤷‍♀️ Then I googled why only 6 months. Then I thought, why am I wasting my time here?  I'm not selling anything. Just sharing great trades and education for free. Don't like it? Block

2021-11-30 18:11:37

@growsolnft @inversebrah My trades speak for themselves.   Almost everything I posted is 50%-500% up. All you need to do is look at my feed. If I was costing people money I wouldn't be making people money.  I called all the big MV tokens 500% ago.  Go away tool.

2021-11-30 18:34:28

@Heisenberg_0721 @HathorNetwork Your average goes up but the amount of the crypto you own also goes up

2021-11-30 18:46:52

@jasonpizzino He paid me to say this, I have been caught

2021-11-30 18:51:39

@GrindingPoet I shower in the salt 😂 and I am loving the copypasta

2021-11-30 18:53:51

@GrindingPoet A paranoid man once said everyone who performs better than me is a grifter 😘

2021-11-30 18:54:25

@GrindingPoet But truth is I made all my money selling feet pics. Not even my feet though, proper grift that one

2021-11-30 18:57:06

@oBryan @GrindingPoet Bull market innit, all I do is trade n tweet

2021-11-30 18:58:04

@AltcoinGordon @GrindingPoet I will get in touch with my feet guy and he will send ya a freebie

2021-11-30 19:00:16

@GrindingPoet @oBryan Not a grift till I make some money, send me some ADA and you can be my first victim

2021-11-30 19:01:38

@AltcoinGordon @GrindingPoet @TysonThe2nd Gordy wants some feet pics

2021-11-30 19:04:51

Ever since finding out what a copypasta was last week, my dream was to become one.   Bucket list item ✅

2021-11-30 19:08:58

@0xAlena Something about to explode

2021-11-30 19:09:39

@crypto_birb 💯 I think ETH is going to go for it!

2021-11-30 19:10:47

@CryptoAllyy Argued with them at first but then I was like, why am I wasting my time? They get off on it.

2021-11-30 19:11:23

@WepoRon @AltcoinGordon @GrindingPoet Oh I heard about  what happened with her yesterday but not looked yet

2021-11-30 19:35:25

@wokchu @infamouskaz @GrindingPoet I was the orig, these dudes copypasta me for follows. I love it   https://t.co/sJAqT4hixP

2021-11-30 19:36:21

@bryptotrader @GrindingPoet No paid group ma'am but I sell feet pics

2021-11-30 19:43:37

@infamouskaz @wokchu @GrindingPoet Sorry 😐

2021-11-30 19:44:18

@Winchester6790 Eh?

2021-11-30 19:46:00

@RAFAELA_RIGO_ @blockchainedbb @futrii @AshleyDCan @SadafJadran @CryptoWendyO @CryptoMellany I am not asking for a follow but I figure you might not realise you ain following if you are shouting me out and all.  Thank you so much for the shout out, you are amazing, I admire you. Fitness and crypto are my life and you are a goddess in both!

2021-11-30 19:47:32

@infamouskaz @wokchu @GrindingPoet Is this the knob that asked for money?

2021-11-30 19:48:05

@SadafJadran @RAFAELA_RIGO_ @blockchainedbb @futrii @AshleyDCan @CryptoWendyO @CryptoMellany Well said

2021-11-30 19:49:18

@RAFAELA_RIGO_ @blockchainedbb @futrii @AshleyDCan @SadafJadran @CryptoWendyO @CryptoMellany Sound like a bit of a knob here. Just saying the algo puts me on people's timeline even if they arent following so they think they are 😘  Love ya regardless, you are 😍

2021-11-30 19:54:03

@infamouskaz @wokchu @GrindingPoet Oh wow and he was giving me crap as a fraud. This is all so priceless

2021-11-30 20:03:17

@infamouskaz @wokchu @GrindingPoet If somebody is trying to sells something and uses the word "scheme" I am instantly turned off.   Love it, thank you for the entertainment fren

@B38B37 Thanks 🥰

2021-11-30 20:21:59

@fabriswhite23 Identify the next big sector and by now.  Adult entertainment and gambling are my plays.  If I am wrong I lose a few k. If I am right I make a few mill.

2021-11-30 20:24:22

@aibdlytics @fabriswhite23 I have too many followers to talk about positions I am slowly building. You will need to do your own research.

2021-11-30 20:24:36

@fabriswhite23 *buy

2021-11-30 20:29:52

All I did was identify the next big sector and invest early   Bought many rugs and crap, the good paid for the bad and then some.  IMO the next big sectors are adult entertainment and gambling.  If I'm wrong I lose a few K, if right I make a few mill  No brainer. NFA DYOR

2021-11-30 20:29:53

No I am NOT sharing what I am buying yet because my following is too big and I am not done buying.   Sorry.   I did my research, you can do yours. Just be sure you spread the money around because much of what you buy will fail.  NFA

2021-11-30 20:31:48

I am not done with the gaming sector though. Gaming will be huge, and in my opinion, it will still mint billionaires.

2021-11-30 20:38:36

@golab44 It could be big but I have yet to research it

2021-11-30 20:39:52

@hiddenhandsz @fabriswhite23  https://t.co/kMrcLH4jni

2021-11-30 20:42:08

@AlinLerint Never try and guess a top or a bottom

2021-11-30 20:45:42

@MikeyFergus_ Yeah no ETH talk 🤣  What the vibe check?

2021-11-30 20:47:14

@ts2929 I don't time the market, I take partial profits at sensible levels and DCA back in when prices dump.  It is absurdly simple and effective

2021-11-30 20:48:20

@fatih20077787 @AltcoinGordon He is fine, he just scared I am becoming the bigger inflenzor so he copying. He can't be me

2021-11-30 20:52:10

@ts2929 I am not picking tops or bottoms l take small profit as things rise and when they eventually dump I reinvest. If something does a 10x before dumping and you withdraw 20% of the profit as it rises, you can throw that 20% back in as it dumps. Not at a bottom but DCA it back in

2021-11-30 21:04:12

@abcdbandit2017 American problems aren't my problems thankfully

2021-11-30 21:08:20

@varun5 Friends shirt, good choice 👍

2021-11-30 21:13:08

@thejosh21 I might do something like this. I do love this idea.

2021-11-30 21:14:27

@mitchel28132619 No fren I am not

2021-11-30 21:16:44

@CryptoWizardd Never make predictions in this game. The market will always make you look like an idiot.

2021-11-30 21:22:29

@Eunicedwong @CryptoWizardd Very good point

2021-11-30 21:25:37

@KingMayo_ @GrindingPoet Give me crap for being a grifter while he copies a tweet to get followers, you just need to appreciate the comedy that is CT fren.

2021-11-30 22:01:45

@ZagWag222 @crypto_caesar1 I wasnt on twitter in July lol

2021-11-30 22:30:52

@infamouskaz NO!

2021-11-30 23:16:54

@ehill111 @Shenlon59928207 @cy_trades Yes I always take profit as something rises and reinvest when it dumps. If there is one thing you can rely on in crypto its frequent swings, so I make use of them

2021-11-30 23:23:29

@The7thEstate Just my warm up weight...

2021-11-30 23:42:23

@snowman_crypto @cloudzombi Always DYOR, smart move

2021-11-30 23:54:27

3/ Writing why I'm buying/selling forces me to think my decision through. If my motivation is fear or greed driven, the pause I take gives me enough time to reassess and change my mind.  If I need to act quick and write it after. It forces me to examine my decision.

2021-11-30 23:54:27

2/ Whenever I buy, sell, or set a limit, I write down why I am taking that action. If I need to act fast writing before is not possible, so, I will write why I took the action after it's done.

2021-11-30 23:54:27

1/ Trading #crypto or in any market requires emotional control.  Many people say "trade without emotion" and I'm guilty of saying it too. We are not robots, we can't remove all emotion.  We need to control our emotions, which is a skill anybody can learn.

2021-11-30 23:54:29

4/ Over time, doing this has given me better control of my emotions. I am not able to identify negative emotions quickly and take control of them. I probably do not need to write, but I still do, it is habit.  It could be something as simple as this.  https://t.co/J2MPlNWnfS

2021-11-30 23:55:40

@jumper_storm @4Profit Sort of but the odds are so high of hitting a few 100x returns because of the nature of crypto

2021-11-30 23:56:41

*now able to  I really need a proof reader 🤦‍♀️

2021-12-01 00:01:25

@2920315914lover Exactly, and it's great to hear you found and got help for the issues!

2021-12-01 00:06:02

@RbfTrader At least I am not alone!

2021-12-01 00:06:28

@Flow0fTech Thanks fren 👍

2021-12-01 00:20:06

@MuroCrypto @MuazCoin Need a crypto gym that has a major crypto price stream on all the televisions!

2021-12-01 00:43:47

@satsdart For me I also realised how much stress it adds to my day to day.

2021-12-01 01:52:11

@Mr_E_Graves 😂 love it  Those are good buys tbf, except Merge, do not believe I've heard of them

2021-12-01 01:53:28

@xrp_ninja Eth failed me as it so often does

2021-12-01 01:56:16

@CryptoTony__ Oh no the KSI reversal indicator

2021-12-01 02:13:40

@xrp_ninja @ixiedaddy We have about the same reaction to that comment!

2021-12-01 02:19:56

@RbfTrader Haha 🤣 it was prophetic

2021-12-01 03:53:06

@joegrecojoe @AltcoinGordon @GrindingPoet No

2021-12-01 04:02:05

@RonnayoPA Rug on cryptos I won't be shilling. Logic.

2021-12-01 06:58:04

@0xCrank @SabehMahmoud Do you guys just like making stuff up? It's not in December, there is a three-month cliff, them 4% per month is unlocked, which isn't much.  https://t.co/oDcVIyEk3i

2021-12-01 07:15:37

@0xCrank @SabehMahmoud Nop, I missed the presale sadly. I always disclose presales like BLOK or ACK
