1/CRAFT - 低市值（2.52亿美元） - #Metaverse &amp; #PlayToEarn - On $AVAX - The game looks amazing - VC vesting is great Not financial advice, do your own research.  @Talecraftio #NFT #NFTGame

2/ -潜力--元老会是一个蓬勃发展的行业。2500万美元的市值将使其进入前80名的metaverse。在我看来，这比前80名要高得多。从长远来看，我希望市值能达到几亿美金。  这不是财务建议，这是我个人的期望。https://t.co/2maYi9Am34

3/ -TOKENOMICS--CRAFT的tokenomics是惊人的。目前有170万的循环供应，最大的供应量是3000万，但有一个燃烧机制，会吃掉500万的供应。  玩游戏需要CRAFT，这将保持对代币的高需求。https://t.co/Dckrhe5ni6

4/ -NO PRESALE DUMPS- 预售的投资者收到TGE的5%，并且在90天内不会收到更多的代币，因此他们不能倾销。在这之后，他们将获得15或18个月的归属权。  良好的归属是一个好项目的标志。https://t.co/Dyz5EruTvV

5/ -BUYING- 购买是一件痛苦的事情。我不得不使用AVAX官方桥接（DYOR）从ERC20桥接到AVAX C链，然后在Trader Joe上购买。  你也可以在KuCoin上购买AVAX并提取到C链。

6/ -我的计划--我将按比例购买点滴。除非是在预售中，否则我从不买满一袋。就像对待任何事情一样，不要做一个蠢货。

1/ $CRAFT  - Low market cap ($252 m) - #Metaverse &amp; #PlayToEarn - On $AVAX - The game looks amazing - VC vesting is great  Not financial advice, do your own research.  @Talecraftio #NFT #NFTGame

2/ -POTENTIAL- Metaverse is a booming sector. A $25m market cap would put this in the top 80 metaverse. In my opinion this is much higher than a top 80. Long-term I would expect a market cap of a few hundred million.  This is not financial advice, it's my personal expectation.  https://t.co/2maYi9Am34

3/ -TOKENOMICS- The tokenomics for CRAFT are phenomenal. 1.7m circulating supply at the moment, the max supply is 30m but there is a burning mechanism which will eat away 5m of the supply.  CRAFT is required in order to play the game, which will keep demand for the token high.  https://t.co/Dckrhe5ni6

4/ -NO PRESALE DUMPS- Presale investors receive 5% on TGE and won't receive more tokens for 90 days, therefore they won't be able to dump. After that, they are vested for 15 or 18 months vesting.  Good vesting is the mark of a good project.  https://t.co/Dyz5EruTvV

5/ -BUYING- Buying was a pain. I had to bridge from ERC20 to AVAX C Chain using the official AVAX bridge (DYOR) and then buy on Trader Joe.  You can also buy AVAX on KuCoin and withdraw to C Chain.

6/ -MY PLAN- I will be scaling in and buying the dips. I never ape in a full bag unless I am in presale. As with anything, do not be a dumbass.
